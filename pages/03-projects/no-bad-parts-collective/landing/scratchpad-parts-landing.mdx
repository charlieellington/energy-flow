## Project Status Board

- [x] Confirmed presence of applications `energy-flow` and `no-bad-parts-landing` in workspace
- [x] Verified each application is an independent git repository with correct remote origins (`charlieellington/energy-flow`, `charlieellington/no-bad-parts-landing`)
- [x] Confirmed `.env` files are protected from version control by the `.gitignore` rules in `no-bad-parts-landing`
- [x] Updated header title from "Product Waitlist Starter" to "No Bad Parts Collective" in `app/layout.tsx`
- [x] Removed deploy to Vercel button from header navigation
- [x] Replaced duplicate sign-in button with "Join the wait-list" button (then removed wait-list button from header for cleaner UX)
- [x] Added **About** explainer page (`about.mdx`) combining landing-page copy and build-plan
- [x] Added external link to "No Bad Parts Collective" references in `about.mdx` for consistent linking.
- [x] Added summarised "What I'm working on" section to energy-flow/pages/index.mdx with links to No Bad Parts Collective, Sunni.be, Waitlist Kit, and Zebra Design

### Planner Notes

---

## Background & Motivation (Planner)
We want the public "No Bad Parts Collective" landing page to match the copy, tone, and imagery on the current Notion "COMING SOON" page while driving sign-ups to the existing wait-list API. The page must also inform visitors that:
1. Development is in progress and we'll invite a closed-alpha cohort soon.
2. Live build updates are visible at **energyflow.studio**.

## Key Challenges
- Extracting structured copy & image assets from a dynamic Notion page.
- Preserving/strengthening the single primary CTA (wait-list button) per conversion-rate best-practice.
- Ensuring SEO (title, description, OG/Twitter meta) reflects the new copy and includes our hero image.
- Minimising layout churn‚Äîreuse existing component skeletons where possible.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Content Harvest**
  - Pull final copy from Notion page (added to `content/nbpc-copy.md`).
  - Verify required images already exist in `/public/assets` (rename/move to `/public/assets/nbpc/` if tidy-up is needed).
- [x] 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Component & Layout Updates** (reordered hero ‚Üí founder ‚Üí waitlist ‚Üí sections)
  - Update `app/page.tsx` (or relevant file) with new headline, sub-headline, body paragraphs.
  - Add "Closed Alpha" strip + link to energyflow.studio.
  - Duplicate the wait-list CTA button in the hero **and** near page footer.
- [x] 3Ô∏è‚É£ **SEO & Metadata**
  - Edit `<Head>` block: `title`, `meta description`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `twitter:card`, canonical.
- [x] 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Image Optimisation**
  - Verified all landing page images use `next/image` with explicit `width`/`height` and `alt` props (see `founder-intro.tsx`, `landing-sections.tsx`).
  - Hero & CTA sections contain no images requiring optimisation.
  - Avatar component intentionally retains native `<img>` for tiny icons;
    ESLint rule disabled to avoid next/image overhead.
- [x] 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Responsive QA** across break-points (mobile first).
- [x] 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Smoke Test**
  - Hit `/api/waitlist` submit path locally and verified success + toast.
- [x] 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Commit & Push**
  - PR title: "feat(landing): update copy/images + SEO for NBPC".
  - Updated screenshot and branding in README.
- [ ] 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Contact Form Inquiry**
  - Assess feasibility of adding contact form that sends messages to charliee@gmail.com via email service (e.g., Resend, SendGrid, or SMTP/Nodemailer).
  - Estimate: 1‚Äì2 hours dev time after service credentials are configured.
  - Pending decision: which email provider to use and whether to store messages.
  - ‚úÖ Resend is already installed and connected; setup time reduced.
  - üéØ **Scope**: expose form only to authenticated users to avoid spam.
  - üñºÔ∏è **Placement**: show at top of page for logged-in users; also repeat at page bottom, replacing the existing "Join the wait-list" CTA section.
  - ‚úçÔ∏è **Copy**: "Got questions or want to contact me? I'll reply to every email."

## Success Criteria
- New copy live at `/` with no 500/404 errors.
- Lighthouse SEO score ‚â• 95.
- Wait-list POST returns 200 in dev & prod.
- Images served locally‚Äînot hot-linked to Notion.

## 2025-05-30 Updates
- Converted concept bullet list into card layout (matches header feature cards) in `no-bad-parts-landing/components/landing-sections.tsx`.
- Replaced "How It Works" ordered list with image cards and new copy.
- Converted Our Ethos bullet list into card layout.
- Added feasibility assessment for contact form emailing charliee@gmail.com (see task 8Ô∏è‚É£).
- Added implementation plan for contact form leveraging existing Resend setup; form limited to logged-in users and positioned top & bottom of page with new copy.
- Implemented comprehensive SEO metadata in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx` (title, description, OG/Twitter images, canonical).
- Completed responsive QA and smoke test locally; updated README.
- [2025-05-30] Replaced default favicon with rainbow emoji by adding `app/icon.svg` and updating `icons` metadata in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx`.
- [2025-05-30] Added gradient divider lines before and after the waitlist section in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/page.tsx` for clearer visual separation, matching the hero section style.
- [2025-05-30] Ran local ESLint and Next.js production builds for **energy-flow** and **no-bad-parts-landing**; both succeeded with zero warnings or errors.

- [2024-06-10] Updated the footer in no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx to only say: 'Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Charlie Ellington at Energy Flow Studio.'

## 2025-06-xx Avatar Upload Flow Decision

- **Decision:** Retain the current avatar-upload step _after_ the user completes the magic-link sign-in ("Option 1" from chat).
- **Rationale:**
  - Re-uses the proven `upload-avatar.ts` helper and `avatars` storage bucket.
  - Avoids anonymous uploads/policy changes while the visitor is unauthenticated.
  - Keeps the wait-list modal lightweight (higher conversion rate).
- **Action Items (when capacity allows):**
  1. Update copy on the post-sign-up profile card to explicitly invite the user to add a photo (currently implicit).
  2. Add a subtle reminder toast if the user dismisses the card without uploading an avatar.
  3. Review clean-up cron for orphaned avatar files (users who never verify) ‚Äî low priority.
- **No immediate code changes required**; existing flow already satisfies the decision.
