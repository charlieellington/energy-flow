# Scratchpad Parts Landing

## Project Status Board

### Planner Notes

---

## Background & Motivation (Planner)
We want the public "No Bad Parts Collective" landing page to match the copy, tone, and imagery on the current Notion "COMING SOON" page while driving sign-ups to the existing wait-list API. The page must also inform visitors that:
1. Development is in progress and we'll invite a closed-alpha cohort soon.
2. Live build updates are visible at **energyflow.studio**.

## Key Challenges
(none)

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Must Have 
- [x] 1️⃣ **Content Harvest**
  - Pull final copy from Notion page (added to `content/nbpc-copy.md`).
  - Verify required images already exist in `/public/assets` (rename/move to `/public/assets/nbpc/` if tidy-up is needed).
- [x] 2️⃣ **Component & Layout Updates** (reordered hero → founder → waitlist → sections)
  - Update `app/page.tsx` (or relevant file) with new headline, sub-headline, body paragraphs.
  - Add "Closed Alpha" strip + link to energyflow.studio.
  - Duplicate the wait-list CTA button in the hero **and** near page footer.
- [x] 3️⃣ **SEO & Metadata**
  - Edit `<Head>` block: `title`, `meta description`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `twitter:card`, canonical.
- [x] 4️⃣ **Image Optimisation**
  - Verified all landing page images use `next/image` with explicit `width`/`height` and `alt` props (see `founder-intro.tsx`, `landing-sections.tsx`).
  - Hero & CTA sections contain no images requiring optimisation.
  - Avatar component intentionally retains native `<img>` for tiny icons;
    ESLint rule disabled to avoid next/image overhead.
- [x] 5️⃣ **Responsive QA** across break-points (mobile first).
- [x] 6️⃣ **Smoke Test**
  - Hit `/api/waitlist` submit path locally and verified success + toast.
- [x] 7️⃣ **Commit & Push**
  - PR title: "feat(landing): update copy/images + SEO for NBPC".
  - Updated screenshot and branding in README.

### Should Have 
- [ ] 8️⃣ **Contact and Feedback 
  - Add Intercomm to the website to gather instant feedback live or by email 
  - Quick solution 
- [ ] 9️⃣ **Buy Now Feature**
  - Feature to be able to move up the waitlist 
  - "buying an annual membership for €100, refundable anytime before launch or before your second call."

## Success Criteria
(none)

## 2025-05-30 Updates
- Converted concept bullet list into card layout (matches header feature cards) in `no-bad-parts-landing/components/landing-sections.tsx`.
- Replaced "How It Works" ordered list with image cards and new copy.
- Converted Our Ethos bullet list into card layout.
- Added feasibility assessment for contact form emailing charliee@gmail.com (see task 8️⃣).
- Added implementation plan for contact form leveraging existing Resend setup; form limited to logged-in users and positioned top & bottom of page with new copy.
- Implemented comprehensive SEO metadata in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx` (title, description, OG/Twitter images, canonical).
- Completed responsive QA and smoke test locally; updated README.
- [2025-05-30] Replaced default favicon with rainbow emoji by adding `app/icon.svg` and updating `icons` metadata in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx`.
- [2025-05-30] Added gradient divider lines before and after the waitlist section in `no-bad-parts-landing/app/page.tsx` for clearer visual separation, matching the hero section style.
- [2025-05-30] Ran local ESLint and Next.js production builds for **energy-flow** and **no-bad-parts-landing**; both succeeded with zero warnings or errors.

- [2024-06-10] Updated the footer in no-bad-parts-landing/app/layout.tsx to only say: 'Made with ❤️ by Charlie Ellington at Energy Flow Studio.'

## 2025-06-xx Avatar Upload Flow Decision

- **Decision:** Retain the current avatar-upload step _after_ the user completes the magic-link sign-in ("Option 1" from chat).
- **Rationale:**
  - Re-uses the proven `upload-avatar.ts` helper and `avatars` storage bucket.
  - Avoids anonymous uploads/policy changes while the visitor is unauthenticated.
  - Keeps the wait-list modal lightweight (higher conversion rate).
- **Action Items (when capacity allows):**
  1. Update copy on the post-sign-up profile card to explicitly invite the user to add a photo (currently implicit).
  2. Add a subtle reminder toast if the user dismisses the card without uploading an avatar.
  3. Review clean-up cron for orphaned avatar files (users who never verify) — low priority.
- **No immediate code changes required**; existing flow already satisfies the decision.
