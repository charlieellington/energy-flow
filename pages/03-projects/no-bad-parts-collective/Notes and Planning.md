# a) Community not a good approach to launch a product 
- "I wanted to build products that offer the same value, regardless if they had 0 or 1000 users."
- If you build a community product, it has no value unless there are lots of users. 
- Which creates a chicken and egg problem 
- Are you building the wrong thing here because for each new user sign up who is willing, you'll also need another one of those. 
- So it won't get the traction. 
- How would I build this so any user gets the same value? 
- Ignore the community part? 
- Or, community is later, what about just building this tool for two people at a time, one can sign up, or two, and they just subscribe to use the tech. The community part, connecting people, happens on a forum or whatsapp group, or just offline with two people? 
- This fits the video idea in c) 


# b) Launch Sooner: 

What I’m learning is that I’m already ready to launch the IFS app - just talk to people 1:1 to plan the connection of two people and see what happens and gather feedback

# c) Video idea (not just IFS)
- Setup UX: 
	- Enter details and custom GPT instructions > Create video link 
- Call UX: 
	- Two people join the call 
	- User one > Does call > Has interface showing the result of their custom GPT instructions 
- Anything can be built with this - charge for the product
