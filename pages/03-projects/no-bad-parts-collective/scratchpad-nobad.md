# Scratchpad

## Current Project Status - January 21, 2025

âœ… **COMPLETED: Project Cleanup - Renamed no-bad-parts-landing to no-bad-parts**

### What was implemented:
- Successfully renamed GitHub repository from "no-bad-parts-landing" to "no-bad-parts"
- Updated git remote URL automatically via GitHub CLI
- Renamed local directory from `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/no-bad-parts-landing` to `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/no-bad-parts`
- Verified git operations work correctly in renamed directory
- Project is now positioned as the main app rather than just a landing page

### Technical details:
- Used GitHub CLI (`gh repo rename no-bad-parts`) to rename repository
- GitHub CLI automatically updated the origin remote URL to https://github.com/charlieellington/no-bad-parts.git
- Local directory rename completed with `mv no-bad-parts-landing no-bad-parts`
- Git status confirmed: branch is up to date with origin/main, working tree clean
- No internal code references needed updating (package.json has no name field, no grep matches found)

### User Experience:
- Project now has cleaner, more professional naming
- Positioned as main application rather than temporary landing page
- Ready for continued development and expansion beyond landing page functionality
- All git operations and GitHub integration working seamlessly
