# Scratchpad

## Current Project Status - January 21, 2025

✅ **COMPLETED: Workspace Structure and Rules Verification & Cleanup**

### What was verified and fixed:
- **Workspace Structure**: Confirmed both projects exist in `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/`
  - `energy-flow/` - Documentation and workspace management project
  - `no-bad-parts/` - Main application (renamed from no-bad-parts-landing)
- **GitHub Connectivity**: Both projects connected and up to date
  - energy-flow: `https://github.com/charlieellington/energy-flow.git`
  - no-bad-parts: `https://github.com/charlieellington/no-bad-parts.git`
- **Cursor Rules Hierarchy**: Fixed malformed file paths in all rule files
  - Workspace level: `.cursor/rules/rule.mdc` (applies to all projects)
  - Project level: `energy-flow/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc` and `no-bad-parts/.cursor/rules/rule.mdc`

### Rules Summary:
**I follow DIFFERENT rules for each project:**

**For energy-flow project:**
- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md rules
- Update energy-flow scratchpad after every action
- General documentation and workspace management rules

**For no-bad-parts project:**
- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md rules  
- Update no-bad-parts scratchpad after every action
- Check build-plan.mdx for project context
- **SPECIAL STYLING RULE**: Use ONLY Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- NO bespoke CSS files or custom React components for styling (warn user first if necessary)

**Workspace level (applies to both):**
- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md from energy-flow project
- Update appropriate scratchpad based on which project is being worked on

### Technical details:
- Fixed malformed file paths that had repeated "energy-flow/energy-flow/" segments
- Verified git status: both repos up to date with origin/main
- Rules now correctly reference documentation files in energy-flow project
- Both projects have proper project-specific rules that extend workspace rules

✅ **COMPLETED: Project Cleanup - Renamed no-bad-parts-landing to no-bad-parts**

### What was implemented:
- Successfully renamed GitHub repository from "no-bad-parts-landing" to "no-bad-parts"
- Updated git remote URL automatically via GitHub CLI
- Renamed local directory from `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/no-bad-parts-landing` to `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/no-bad-parts`
- Verified git operations work correctly in renamed directory
- Project is now positioned as the main app rather than just a landing page

### Technical details:
- Used GitHub CLI (`gh repo rename no-bad-parts`) to rename repository
- GitHub CLI automatically updated the origin remote URL to https://github.com/charlieellington/no-bad-parts.git
- Local directory rename completed with `mv no-bad-parts-landing no-bad-parts`
- Git status confirmed: branch is up to date with origin/main, working tree clean
- No internal code references needed updating (package.json has no name field, no grep matches found)

### User Experience:
- Project now has cleaner, more professional naming
- Positioned as main application rather than temporary landing page
- Ready for continued development and expansion beyond landing page functionality
- All git operations and GitHub integration working seamlessly
