# 🔄 Scratchpad Moved for Security

**This scratchpad has been moved to the project directory for security reasons.**

**New Location:** `/Users/charlieellington1/coding/no-bad-parts/scratchpad.md`

**Reason:** To prevent accidental exposure of tokens, API keys, or sensitive development information in the documentation repository.

---

## Access via:
- **Local file:** `no-bad-parts/scratchpad.md`
- **Git repo:** Private repository only (not in public docs)

**All future project status updates will be logged in the new location.**

*This file serves as a redirect notice only.*

## Current Status: FRONT-END POC COMPLETE ✅

**Part 4 Implementation**: Successfully completed front-end with working LiveKit integration

**✅ FINAL WORKING URLs:**
- Partner Page: http://localhost:3000/session/partner  
  - Full-screen video with LiveKit connection
  - Shows "No Bad Parts • alpha" header
  - Webcam access working
  
- Facilitator Page: http://localhost:3000/session/facilitator
  - Split-screen layout (2/3 video, 1/3 hints panel)  
  - Left: LiveKit video feed
  - Right: AI hints panel with "Waiting for AI hints..." message
  - HintStream component ready for real agent connection

**✅ Dev Server Status**: 
- **CORRECTED**: Running from `/no-bad-parts` directory on port 3000
- Both session pages responding with HTTP 200 OK
- LiveKit dependencies installed and working
- Ready for **Step 4.5** (Local Integration Test)

**✅ Technical Implementation**:
- LiveKit dependencies installed: @livekit/components-react v2.9.9, @livekit/components-styles v1.1.6, livekit-client v2.13.3
- App directory routes created (app/session/partner/page.tsx, app/session/facilitator/page.tsx)
- LiveKit wrapper with proper token handling
- HintStream component with real-time message display
- Environment variables properly configured with tokens

**✅ Security Framework**: 
- API keys secured in environment-reference.md (git-ignored)
- All build documentation sanitized
- CONTRIBUTING.md enhanced with API key security guidelines
- Ready for production deployment

**🎯 NEXT STEP**: Execute **Step 4.5** (Local Integration Test)
- Start Python agent with full SYSTEM_PROMPT in separate terminal
- Test end-to-end: Partner speech → Agent transcription → IFS coaching hints in facilitator panel
- Validate complete POC pipeline before cloud deployment

**Environment**: LiveKit tokens valid until June 13, 2025
**Ready for**: Full POC demonstration with real AI agent integration

**FINAL WORKING ARCHITECTURE**:
