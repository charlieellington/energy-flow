# No Bad Parts Collective

**AI-Powered Silent Coach for IFS Sessions** - [nobadpartscollective.com](https://nobadpartscollective.com)

## ðŸŽ¥ Working Demo Available!

No Bad Parts Collective is my main focus right now - building technology that enhances human connection rather than replacing it. Our "Silent Coach" demo shows how AI can support Internal Family Systems (IFS) facilitators with real-time hints while keeping the human relationship at the center.

### How It Works

```
Partner speaks â†’ AI transcribes â†’ GPT-4 generates IFS hints â†’ Facilitator sees hints in sidebar
```

All in real-time (~2 second latency), completely silent to the partner.
