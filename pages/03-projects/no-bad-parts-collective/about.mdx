# About the [No Bad Parts Collective](https://www.nobadpartscollective.com/)

> Peer-led Internal Family Systems exploration â€” humans first, AI second.

[No Bad Parts Collective](https://www.nobadpartscollective.com/) is an experiment in compassionate, peer-to-peer inner-work. Two community members meet in a private video room: **one explores, the other facilitates**. A silent AI agent stays backstage, streaming gentle prompts to the facilitator's coach panel so they can stay fully present with the explorer.

## ðŸŽ¥ Live Demo Available!

We have a working proof-of-concept that demonstrates the "Silent Coach" in action:

- **Partner View**: Full-screen video call for natural conversation
- **Facilitator View**: Video + real-time AI coaching hints sidebar
- **AI Agent**: Listens to audio, transcribes with Whisper, generates IFS-style hints with GPT-4
- **Real-time delivery**: Hints appear within ~2 seconds via WebSocket

## Technical Stack

The current demo ([GitHub](https://github.com/charlieellington/no-bad-parts)) uses:

- **Next.js 14** + Daily for video rooms
- **Python Pipecat** orchestrating Whisper â†’ GPT-4
- **FastAPI WebSocket** for real-time hint delivery
- **Fly.io** (agent) + **Vercel** (front-end) deployment

This gives facilitators private, real-time suggestions without interrupting the partner's flow.

## Why "No Bad Parts"?

Our name comes from Richard Schwartz's book *No Bad Parts*. Internal Family Systems (IFS) teaches that every part of you serves a purposeâ€”none of them are "bad". We borrow these ideas but are **not** affiliated with IFS or Richard Schwartz, and certainly **not** a replacement for professional care. Think of us as a peer-led supplement for personal exploration.

## How It Works

1. **Book** â€” sign up and schedule a session with another Collective member.  
2. **Explore IFS** â€” stay present while a peer guides you through an IFS-inspired journey.  
3. **Facilitate with AI** â€” next time you hold space for someone else while the AI whisper-prompts in your ear.

Key principles:

- Real, face-to-face presence â€” no chatbot monologues.
- AI stays backstage, offering prompts so the facilitator can stay present.
- Role-swap model: everyone gives as much as they receive.

## Our Ethos

We're all equals hereâ€”there is no therapist â‡„ client divide. Yet we are **not** therapists or counsellors. If you have urgent or ongoing mental-health needs, please seek help from a qualified professional.

- **Compassion & Respect** â€” every part of us deserves a voice.  
- **Peer Support, Not Therapy** â€” a friendly place to explore, never a replacement for licensed care.  
- **Shared Learning** â€” we refine our approach together and welcome feedback.  

*Embrace your parts. They have much to sayâ€”none of them bad, each with its own wisdom.*
