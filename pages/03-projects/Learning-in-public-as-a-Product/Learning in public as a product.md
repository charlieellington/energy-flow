Iâ€™m building a peer-to-peer app that uses AI prompts to guide Internal Family Systems sessions. Here I share each tiny experiment and lesson in plain view, inviting honest feedback as I go. The aim is to learn in public while staying clear-eyed and free from the doom-scroll.

**Experiment:** 
"You don't have to be right, just see for one month or maybe 2 weeks"

### Priorities 
What it is: 
- Integrated: learning in public 
- Part of my workflow 
- Community to practice IFS is the product, not me. 
What it is not: 
- Choosing between visibility and productivity, but both simultaneously
Prioritiy above this: 
- Launching with two people using it found through 1:1 connection or finding existing IFS communities and sharing. 
- This is just to keep fostering human connection so it can flourish and maybe help more people. 

---
### Hypotheses: 
Am I doing the above priorities or chasing likes? 
Am I still productive? 
Am I building with others and gathering feedback?
