Thanks, that's clear. I'll create a short, up-to-date prompt guide for generating the best videos using OpenAI's Sora. The guide will include concise frameworks tailored for different types of videos—cinematic, explainer, animated, and realistic—and dive deeper into formats like social media and storytelling when the prompt structure differs.

I'll let you know as soon as it's ready.

# Prompting Guide for OpenAI Sora Video Generation (Mid-2025)

## Best Practices Overview

**Clarity and Focus:** Sora’s output quality depends entirely on your prompt – vague requests produce generic or distorted videos, while clear, detailed prompts yield richer visuals and smoother motion. Be **specific** about key elements: include concrete details on characters, settings, actions, and even emotions to guide the scene. At the same time, avoid overloading the prompt with too many ideas. **Keep it concise:** overly long or granular prompts can overwhelm the model’s context window. Recent community tests found prompts under ~120 words focusing on one or two main concepts perform best. In summary, describe **exactly** what you want to see, but focus on the **essentials** – you can always refine with follow-up prompts or Sora’s editing tools if needed. Also, write prompts in English (Latin script) for optimal results.

**Prompt Structure:** Treat your prompt like a **mini screenplay or story snippet**. Start with a brief overview that sets the scene and main subject, then add specific details. For example, begin with an establishing description (“A calm seaside at dawn with a lone surfer paddling out...”) before detailing camera angles or actions. Use **vivid adjectives** and sensory descriptions to paint a clear picture (e.g. _tranquil_, _foggy_, _neon-lit_), rather than vague terms. If your scene has multiple parts or a progression, describe them in sequence (you can even say “First, ..., then ...”) so Sora understands the intended timeline. Maintain a logical flow – a clear beginning, middle, and end will help Sora follow the sequence of events. Finally, consider specifying the **tone or genre** if relevant (e.g. “in the style of a documentary” or “with a whimsical, cartoonish tone”) to align the video’s style with your vision.

## Cinematic Video Prompts

**Aim for a film-like quality.** For cinematic outputs, use language a filmmaker would use. Include **camera shots and angles** to direct Sora’s “camera” – e.g. _wide shot_, _close-up_, _POV_, _over-the-shoulder_. This guides the framing and composition of the scene. You can also specify **camera movements**: terms like _pan left across the room_, _dolly in slowly_, or _crane shot ascending_ prompt Sora to simulate dynamic motion. Don’t forget the **lighting and mood** – cinematic scenes often rely on evocative lighting (for instance, _“soft golden-hour sunlight”_ for a warm, dramatic scene, or _“neon-lit urban glow”_ for a sci-fi vibe). Mentioning colour tone or atmosphere helps Sora set the mood. Keep the scene focused: it’s better to fully flesh out one dramatic sequence than to cram in too many plot points. If needed, indicate a **transition or cut** (e.g. _“cut to a close-up of her face”_) to signal scene changes or important moments. Below is an example of a cinematic-style prompt:

> _Example (Cinematic):_ _“At dusk in a rain-soaked city street, a detective in a trench coat walks through puddles under flickering neon signs. **Wide shot** as he approaches a lonely phone booth. The **camera dollies in** behind him, then **cuts to a close-up** of his face as he lights a cigarette, smoke mixing with the foggy air. **Soft, moody lighting** and long shadows create a film noir atmosphere.”_

This prompt sets the scene, uses cinematic cues (wide shot, camera movement, close-up), and conveys mood – increasing the chance of a visually striking, movie-like result.

## Explainer Video Prompts

**Keep it straightforward and informative.** Explainer videos (e.g. educational or how-to content) benefit from a **simple, structured prompt**. Clearly state the topic and the visual metaphor or diagram you want. It often helps to break the explanation into **steps or segments** in your prompt. For example, if illustrating a process, you might write: “Show [X]. Then demonstrate [Y]. Finally, show [Z].” Sora can handle sequential actions if described clearly. You can even request **text labels or annotations** for key concepts – but use very short text (single words or brief phrases) for best results. Sora is now capable of rendering simple on-screen text fairly legibly when prompted with quotes or labels. For instance, “...display a diagram of a plant leaf, with labels **‘Sunlight’**, **‘Water’**, **‘CO₂’** appearing one by one next to their respective icons” would prompt Sora to animate those labels sequentially. Ensure the visual style is clean and focused: you might specify a **“flat 2D infographic style on a white background”** or **“chalkboard sketch animation”** – this tells Sora to keep the imagery simple and clarity-focused. Avoid unnecessary cinematic flourishes; for explainers, clarity trumps drama. The tone should be **neutral and instructive**. An example prompt for an explainer might be:

> _Example (Explainer):_ _“**2D animated infographic style.** A **timeline diagram** appears, illustrating the steps of baking bread. **Step 1:** a bowl with flour and water, label ‘Mix ingredients’. **Step 2:** dough rising in a bowl, label ‘Let it rise’. **Step 3:** a loaf in an oven, label ‘Bake at 180°C’. Use simple icons and arrows. The scene is well-lit and minimal, emphasising each step clearly.”_

This prompt explicitly breaks down the content into steps with labels, guiding Sora to produce a clear, step-by-step explainer video (you would add voice-over or text narration separately, as Sora outputs visuals only). By structuring the prompt in an ordered way, you help Sora maintain **logical flow and smooth transitions** for educational content.

## Animated/Cartoon Video Prompts

**Embrace imaginative style.** For animated or cartoon-like videos, you should explicitly describe the **art style and characters** you want. Sora can produce a wide range of animation styles – from hand-drawn 2D cartoons to 3D Pixar-like scenes or even anime. Start by specifying if it’s _“a colourful 2D cartoon”_ or _“a 3D animation”_, etc. Include adjectives that capture the look: _“whimsical, bright colours, bold outlines”_ for a cartoon or _“detailed 3D with realistic textures”_ for a CGI animation. Don’t be afraid to set a fantastical or playful tone – Sora excels at **creative and fun prompts** that would be hard to film in real life. You can personify animals or objects and Sora will follow along, as long as you describe them clearly. It also helps to mention the **emotion or theme** (e.g. _“light-hearted and playful”_ or _“uplifting adventure”_) so the model can infuse that feeling into the visuals. For consistency, give distinct characters names or descriptors and reuse them: e.g. _“a small panda inventor”_ – and keep calling it _“the panda”_ for subsequent actions, to keep the character design consistent across frames.

For animated content, **visual exaggeration** is okay – you might describe cartoonish effects like “squiggly motion lines” or “comic-book style speech bubble” if appropriate. Sora’s understanding of these might not be perfect, but it will attempt to stylize the output accordingly. You can also combine imaginative elements with realistic detail to get a high-quality animated look. For example, one prompt described _“a short fluffy monster kneeling by a candle, **art style is 3D and realistic**, with warm, dramatic lighting”_ – this yielded a vivid scene blending fantasy and realism.

> _Example (Animated):_ _“**Animated 3D fantasy style.** A young wizard and a friendly dragon sit by a campfire in a dark forest. The wizard wears a blue robe and pointed hat, and the small dragon has emerald scales. **Soft purple moonlight** filters through the trees. The style is **Pixar-like** – cute character designs with realistic textures. The dragon breathes a tiny flame to light the fire, eyes wide in wonder. The mood is magical and **whimsical**, with fireflies glowing around them.”_

In this example, the prompt explicitly calls for an animated 3D style (Pixar-like), describes the characters and setting in detail, and sets a magical, whimsical tone. This helps Sora understand it should produce a **fantastical, cohesive animated scene** rather than a realistic one. Always tailor the level of detail to the animation style – a simple cartoon might need fewer texture details but strong colours and clear shapes, whereas a 3D animation can include more lighting and texture info.

## Realistic Video Prompts

**Make it lifelike.** To get the most realistic video outputs, describe the scene as if you’re describing a real video shoot. Set the **location and context** clearly (e.g. _“a busy London street at midday in summer”_ or _“inside a cosy kitchen during morning light”_). Include details of **lighting and camera equipment** if relevant – for example, _“shot on a handheld smartphone camera”_ suggests a shaky, on-the-ground realism, whereas _“shot on a 35mm film camera”_ implies cinematic quality realism. Sora is capable of remarkably accurate real-world visuals, so prompt with confidence in everyday details (clothing, weather, environment textures, etc.). Use terms like _“photorealistic”_ or _“documentary-style”_ if you want an especially true-to-life aesthetic. You can also specify lens or perspective: _“GoPro chest-mounted view”_, _“drone aerial view sweeping over the landscape”_, _“dashcam perspective”_, etc., to anchor the viewpoint in reality.

While Sora can create **highly realistic scenes**, be mindful of its current limits to get the best results. **Avoid extreme close-ups of faces** or scenes demanding perfect small details – for instance, human faces may look slightly off if shown very close. Medium shots or wider shots of people tend to appear more convincing. Similarly, don’t rely on Sora for fine text (like street signs or lots of written text in scene) – those may appear gibberish; add any important text in post-production instead of in-prompt. Also, keep action physics plausible: Sora sometimes struggles with complex physical interactions or very precise, timed events. So, a prompt like _“a person pours a glass of water which then freezes into ice mid-air”_ might confuse the model. It’s better to stick to **believable motion** and let Sora excel at realism in lighting, textures, and natural movement. If your scene is complex, consider simplifying it or breaking it into two prompts (or use Sora’s editing tools to iterate).

> _Example (Realistic):_ _“**Handheld documentary style.** A hiker stands on the edge of a cliff in the Scottish Highlands, facing strong winds. **Overcast daylight** makes the colours muted. The camera is a bit **shaky (handheld)** as it follows behind him, emphasizing the height and vast valley below. He turns and smiles toward the camera briefly. The video looks **photorealistic**, as if filmed on location – detailed rocks in the foreground, mist rolling over distant green hills.”_

This prompt sets up a very life-like scenario with specific camera style (handheld documentary), lighting (overcast daylight), and environment details. It avoids extreme close-ups or improbable effects, playing to Sora’s strengths in generating realistic outdoor scenery. The result would likely be a convincing nature footage style clip. Remember that Sora can closely mimic real footage, but always review the output for small quirks – if something looks off, tweak your prompt (e.g. adjust the description or remove an element) and try again. Sora is still improving, so a bit of trial and error is normal in pursuit of the perfect realistic video.

## Social Media Format Tips

When crafting prompts for social media content, think **short, punchy, and visually engaging**. Social platforms often use **vertical video**, and Sora supports various aspect ratios – including vertical 9:16 formats (up to 1080×1920) ideal for mobile viewing. You can set the aspect ratio in Sora’s editor, but it’s also useful to mention any format constraints in the prompt if relevant (e.g. _“framed for vertical video”_ to ensure important action is centred).

For social media videos, you usually want to **grab attention in the first seconds**. In your prompt, start with the most eye-catching element of the scene so Sora begins the video with impact. For example, instead of a long build-up, prompt something like: _“A burst of confetti explodes in front of a cheering crowd…”_ as the opening. Keeping the scene **simple and bold** often works better than complex storytelling here – one clear message or visual joke is more shareable. You can adopt a **fun or trendy tone**, as Sora does well with lighthearted, creative content (whimsical or playful scenarios tend to succeed). If you want a meme-like or **viral style** video, you might reference that in the prompt with phrases like “in a TikTok-style montage” or “fast-paced cuts and zooms” – Sora will attempt to follow with quick transitions or lively pacing. (Do note that very rapid cuts or text overlays might not be perfect, since Sora has some limits in precise timing editing. But hinting at a _“montage of highlights”_ or similar can still yield a dynamic result.)

**Keep it short and coherent.** Sora’s max video length is 20 seconds, but on social media even 5–15 seconds is plenty. Focus your prompt on the core visual; don’t try to fit too many scenes. For example, instead of showing a whole travel vlog in one go, you might prompt a single stunning location shot or a quick before-and-after transformation – something that can stand on its own in a feed. The goal is a **visually striking snippet** that communicates instantly. Also consider **audio**: Sora does not generate sound, so plan to add music or narration later if needed. This means your visual should be understandable without sound. Prompting for noticeable actions or text cues can help (e.g. “**big bold text on screen: ‘SALE 50% OFF!’**” – though Sora’s text rendering isn’t perfect, it might produce something approximating it, which you can refine). Alternatively, leave space in the visuals where you intend to overlay actual text or captions afterward.

In summary, for social media prompts: use vertical framing, lead with striking imagery, keep the concept simple, and align the tone with what’s trending or attention-grabbing. An example could be:

> _Example (Social Media):_ _“**Vertical 9:16 video.** A quick, **fast-motion montage** of a room makeover: blank messy room instantly swaps to a beautifully decorated home office with plants and lights. **Snap transitions** – with each snap of a finger, a new item appears (desk, chair, computer, wall art). Bright, high-energy feel, as if a TikTok transformation trend.”_

This prompt is tailored for a short, flashy social clip – it explicitly notes vertical format and rapid transitions. The language (“snap transitions”, “fast-motion montage”) cues Sora to attempt a quick-cut style. The concept (room makeover) is simple and visual, perfect for grabbing eyeballs on social media.

## Storytelling and Narrative Prompts

If you want to use Sora for storytelling – even within a 20-second limit – you should structure your prompt to **guide the narrative flow**. Think of it as writing a super-short screenplay: introduce the character/scene, present a small conflict or action, and resolve or conclude. A clear **beginning, middle, and end** in the prompt will help Sora maintain a coherent story arc. For example: _“A knight walks through a dark forest at night (beginning). He hears a roar and turns to face a dragon emerging from the trees (middle). They stare at each other, then the dragon peacefully bows and the knight smiles in relief (end).”_ In that prompt, each sentence denotes a narrative stage. Sora will try to honor that sequence in the generated video.

For multi-scene narratives (e.g. two or three distinct shots in one video), clearly **delineate the scenes** in your text. You can use sentences or phrases like “Cut to…” or “Meanwhile…” to signal a change of scene or perspective. Sora is capable of stringing together a few shots **with persistent characters and settings** if the prompt makes it obvious they’re continuing (the model has contextual understanding to keep the same character across shots). To help this, keep using the same descriptors for the same character or object. For instance, if you call your protagonist “a young girl in a red coat” initially, later say “the girl in the red coat” instead of introducing a new term – this consistency helps Sora maintain continuity.

Another tip for narrative prompts is to specify the **pacing or transitions** if you have a preference. Words like _“slowly”_, _“suddenly”_, _“meanwhile”_ can convey timing. You might say, _“Over 5 seconds, the scene shifts from day to night”_ if you want a time-lapse effect (bearing in mind Sora might not nail exact seconds, but it will grasp the idea of a gradual transition).

For more **complex storytelling or longer sequences**, consider using Sora’s **Storyboard** feature rather than a single text prompt. The Storyboard editor lets you break the video into segments or even individual frames with specific instructions – useful if you want tight control over a narrative with multiple shots. In a prompt-only approach, you’re somewhat limited to what Sora can infer in one go. With Storyboard, you could, for example, generate the beginning scene, then use “Remix” or “Re-cut” to extend or modify the next part, ensuring each segment is as intended. If sticking to text prompts, you can also chain prompts manually: generate the first clip of your story, then describe the next scene in a new prompt referencing the first clip’s content (this is a way to do episodic storytelling with Sora).

**Tone and genre** are important in narrative prompts as well. Be explicit about the storytelling style: is it a fairy tale? A suspenseful thriller? A silent movie-style comedy? This will affect how Sora visualises the sequence. For instance, a _“bedtime story tone, gentle and warm”_ might yield softer visuals and smoother transitions, whereas _“action-packed trailer style”_ will likely produce more dramatic angles and faster cuts. Adjust your language accordingly: short, punchy sentences for action; fluid, descriptive sentences for a calmer story.

> _Example (Storytelling):_ _“A **short narrative** in one clip: **Opening scene:** A young baker leans on his shop counter at dawn, looking sad as no customers come in. **Suddenly,** a kind old man enters and smiles, pointing to the bread. **Next scene:** The baker eagerly serves the man a loaf. **Closing shot:** More customers start to fill the bakery as morning sun beams in, and the baker grins with hope.”_

In this prompt, phrases like “Opening scene” and “Closing shot” help structure the story. The narrative is simple (a problem introduced and resolved) and fits in a very short video. Sora would likely produce a sequence of shots showing the empty bakery, then the arrival of the customer, and finally a bustling shop – all within the allotted time. By clearly outlining each part, you guide Sora to **simulate a story with continuity**.

---

**Final Tip:** _Iterate and refine._ Sora is a powerful model that **combines realism and imagination** in video, but getting the perfect output may take a few tries. Don’t hesitate to adjust wording, add or remove details, or try different angles if the first result isn’t spot-on. Use the community’s findings – e.g. if a certain phrasing works better (many prompt engineers share templates and examples) – and keep up with any new Sora features or presets introduced through 2025. By following the frameworks above for cinematic, explainer, animated, and realistic videos (and tailoring your prompt for social media or storytelling needs), you’ll be well-equipped to **write high-performing Sora prompts** that bring your creative visions to life. Good luck, and happy video creating!
