# Learning In Public As A Product


I’m building a peer-to-peer app that uses AI prompts to guide Internal Family Systems sessions. Here I share each tiny experiment and lesson in plain view, inviting honest feedback as I go. The aim is to learn in public while staying clear-eyed and free from the doom-scroll.

--- 

**Experiment:** 
"You don't have to be right, just see for one month or maybe 2 weeks" 

--- 

### Priorities 
What it is: 
- Integrated: learning in public 
- Part of my workflow 
- Community to practice IFS is the product, not me. 
What it is not: 
- Choosing between visibility and productivity, but both simultaneously
Prioritiy above this: 
- Launching with two people using it found through 1:1 connection or finding existing IFS communities and sharing. 
- This is just to keep fostering human connection so it can flourish and maybe help more people. 

---
### Hypotheses: 
Am I doing the above priorities or chasing likes? 
Am I still productive? 
Am I building with others and gathering feedback?

# PACT 
What is a PACT* 

### Post a video three times a week to youtube** for three weeks and review if you want to continue. 

-

PACT* = In _Tiny Experiments_, Anne-Laure Le Cunff says a PACT is a self-designed promise to carry out one **Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous and Trackable** action for a fixed time—so you learn through tiny experiments rather than chase distant goals.

** Youtube: 
- **Evergreen reach:** videos keep surfacing through search and recommendations for months, so each upload compounds instead of expiring after two days.
- **Deeper feedback:** threaded, timestamped comments invite thoughtful discussion—ideal for nuanced IFS topics.
- **Low-distraction setup:** schedule uploads in YouTube Studio, answer comments in a weekly block, and skip the home-feed entirely.
- **Room to grow:** Community posts, playlists and live streams sit on the same channel, giving you future options without adding new apps.

## Process Documentation and Scratchpad  

### Format for videos: 
- What I did
- Why
- Positive
- Negative
- Next

### Script 
- Write a basic script 

### Content and Visuals
- Load up pages or visuals 
- Load up Discord to record and find the right viewport 

### Record 
- On Descript
- Use good mic 

### Edit
- Descript basic, removes ummms ahhhs, etc. 

### b-roll creation 
- Transcript to o3 and create b-roll prompts 
- Prompt b-roll in Soras 

### Edit in b-roll 
- https://clip.opus.pro/dashboard 
- Use Opus Clip to place the b-roll with AI quickly 
- Export and download 
- Upload to Youtube 

### Thumbnail 
- Create thumbnail: **Brand consistency via a five-minute LoRA.** Drop 10–20 headshots into **“Train Flux LoRA – Portrait Trainer”** ($2 per run). In ~5 min you get a lightweight LoRA you can bolt onto FLUX.1 and generate endless thumbnails featuring _your_ face, perfectly on-brand. https://chatgpt.com/c/683efb74-11f0-800a-9601-05aeef14b036 
- Publish on Youtube 

### Package for short-form 
- Take long form video 
- Put into Opus Clip and AI makes the short versions 
- Add captions 
- Upload to youtube 
- Upload to instagram (stealth for now)

### Review 

See above to do Positive, Negative and Next and answer your hypotheses. 


--- 

### Later 

- Put long-form video or shorts in substack and share to email subscribers 


--- 
### Future idea 
- If you keep doing the above, automate: 
	- Human following the docs 
	- Create it as a tool - the outcome would be that you upload your video you recorded, the tool does the rest right through to publishing. 
- In both human and tool could be something you sell
