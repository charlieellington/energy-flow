## Launch v.1 

Launch: 
- Launch in batches of 10: friends and family (cost price), early early bird, early bird, standard
- Bene runs more campaigns, including the ones to share and win, etc. 

Expo: 
- Only opportunity to buy at the beginning, during expo, back to early-bird pricing 



## Uncertainties 

- Billing amount and delivery on launch? 
- When delivered? August? 
- Pay 4 months now upfront? 
- Early bird pricing amounts
