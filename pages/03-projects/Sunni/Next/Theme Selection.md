### How the new shop will come together – and why the first step is choosing a theme

What's happening:

1. **We’re moving Sunni to Shopify.**  
    Shopify handles payments, security and hosting for us, so you won’t need to wrestle with servers or strange dashboards. It also gives us a tidy visual editor for day-to-day tweaks (text, images, prices).
    
2. **A “theme” is Shopify’s starter house.**  
    Think of a theme as the walls, rooms and plumbing already in place. We’ll repaint, move some furniture, hang your pictures—but the wiring is done. Picking the right house now saves a lot of later messing about.
    
3. **Once a theme is picked, I’ll re-skin it.**
    
    - Swap in the Sunni logo and brown accent colour.
        
    - Recreate your homepage sections (hero image, benefits grid, “How it works”, ocean-cleanup note).
        
    - Keep all backgrounds white so the art pops.
        
    - Build the header (logo + menu) and the neat three-column footer.  
        All the heavy coding happens here, but it’s on my side. You’ll just review and say “yes, that looks right”.
        
4. **One-time product import.**  
    All your frames, sizes, prices and images live in Supabase now. I’ll export them to a single CSV file, drop that into Shopify, and—bang—the whole catalogue appears, images included, no manual uploads. After launch you’ll add new products straight in Shopify’s friendly admin.
    
5. **Go live.**  
    I’ll switch on payments, shipping and the custom domain. The shop is open. Later we’ll bolt on the subscription idea via a simple “Subscribe” button that points to your wait-list app.

**What to do now:**  
Open the six previews, scroll the homepage and a product page, and note which one _feels_ closest to how you want Sunni to look. Don’t worry about colours or wording—we’ll change those. Focus on layout: image sizes, menu style, how product pages feel on mobile. Drop me your favourite and we’ll start tailoring it.
