# Zebra Design is Live! ðŸ¦“

I'm excited to announce that [Zebra Design](https://zebradesign.io/) is officially launched!

## What is Zebra Design?

Zebra Design is my new solo practice offering **Design & Code, On-Demand** for ambitious startups and SMEs. It's the culmination of 10 years in product design and my recent embrace of AI-powered development.

## Key Offerings

- **2-4 week launches** instead of months
- **Full-stack development** (front-end + back-end)
- **Built-in user testing** for validation
- **Monthly subscription** starting ~â‚¬5k (cancel anytime)

## Why Now?

After co-founding Deep Work Studio and working with Web3 innovators like Ethereum and MakerDAO, I saw how traditional design-to-dev handoffs created bottlenecks. In 2025, I discovered AI-assisted coding could unify design and development for ultra-fast results.

## Proven Track Record

The website showcases projects that prove the AI-first approach works:
- **Therapist AI Tool** - Built in 1 week
- **Waitlist Platform** - Built in 2 days
- **Sunni Photo Concept** - Built in 2 weeks

Plus my design background with companies that raised $120M+ (Ramp Network) and manage $200M+ (Nexus Mutual).

## The Philosophy

> "Ship fast. Test with users. Iterate quickly. That's how I help you launch products that succeed."

I'm not just another agency. I'm your hands-on partner who codes alongside AI to deliver real products, not just mockups.
