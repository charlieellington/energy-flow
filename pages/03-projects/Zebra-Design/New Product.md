**Headline/Tagline:**

Zebra Design 

Designers that code with AI 

I help you to launch your digital product faster with a user-focused partnership. 

Idea to tested product in weeks, not in months 

Made for startup founders, small-medium businesses and product teams. 

A design as a service modal to design **and** develop your app lightening fast.

EXAMPLES 

Things I've build in Cursor: 
- IFS application 
- Waitlist app 
- Sunni 
I've spent the last three months amazed by what I can build using AI. Zebra design now takes a design centric approach to design and build your next product. 

Things I've Designed and Experience: 
- MakerDAO 
- Ethereum 
- Ramp Network 
- Nexus Mutual 
I founded a design studio that designed cutting-edge products with some of the web3 space leading teams. Our methodology was central to fast product market fit and user driven scientific processes. I now take the same approach going to code rather than delivering Figma designs.

“Only hire people who are either going to **write code or go out and get users**, because those are the only things you need at first.” - Paul Graham, The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups, **This is what I've based Zebra Design on**

--- 

Typical approaches: 

“6-month dev estimates turning into 12-month nightmares”
Using AI and Cursor I've been building user-centric MVPs in weeks. 

“Designs that don’t match what developers build" 
10+ years launching early stage products as a freelancer and founder of Deep Work. Ramp Network raised $120million on the product I designed. Ethereum launch Eth 2.0 staking on the interface we designed. And, Nexus Mutual leads the web3 insurance space. 

“Freelancers who disappear or get priorities wrong”
I've been a startup founder launching three different companies - I understand your needs and what actually matters when launching a product - speed and talking to users. 

Burning cash without validated learning
Deep Work Studio, my last design agency, perfected the model of early testing prototypes, a scentific process to design and getting validated designs in weeks instead of months. 

--- 
(this is below those four points)

A Different Approach using AI coding: Design and Code, Unified. Product and Users First. 
We run a rapid design sprint with your stakeholders, build your prototype **in code** (not just static mockups), and test it with real users – all in a few weeks. Then, as we iterate, we’re your on-call product team delivering new features on a subscription model. No more delays or runaway costs. 

--- 

What to expect: 

(this section is squares)

Workshops 
Rapidly align stakeholders and the domain experts in the design process. No more tedious feedback loops as designers and developers fail to understand the problem. 

Prototype in Code
We design high-fidelity UI and build the front-end in real code - the finished product! In days instead of months for your first MVP. 

User Testing
We conduct rapid user tests on the MVP to gather feedback. No more months of building the wrong thing and user-centric decisions made to continue the product. 

Continuous Build 
We implement feedback, continue developing (e.g. connect the backend), and polish with a user-centric design to code approach. Ongoing, we add features _on demand_ via your subscription.

--- 

**Speed:** _Idea to clickable product in ~2-4 weeks._ (Use a lightning icon)

**Validated Results:** _Built-in user testing to ensure your product hits the mark._ (target icon or checkmark icon)

**Clear Pricing**: One agreed monthly price, unlimited design and code requests, no surprise bills. Pause or cancel anytime.

**Quality Design**: Beautiful, consistent UI and pride in details. Using front-end UI library's to speed up going to market which are focused on optimal User Experience. Don't be slowed down by custom designs that don't move the needle. 

**Full-Stack:** _Front-end, backend, whatever you need. We can deliver a complete product, not just Figma designs scrappily handed over to a development team. 

**Stakeholder Alignment:** Collaborative workshops include your team’s knowledge. Everyone moves in one direction from day one and remove tedious feedback loops of freelancers and agencies. (teamwork icon)

Who Is This For?

“I’m a startup founder who needs to test a new app idea ASAP.”

"We have a team of developers and want a design, front-end engineer to work alongside them to rapidly create our product."

 “We’re an SME that needs a custom internal tool built and we have no design or engineering team." 

“I have an MVP, but no design — I need a UX/UI overhaul and new features fast.”

“We need our product to finally start moving forward; freelancers and agencies have let us down.”

Process Details / Why It Works:

(update this section with the last output and results on how we're doing to structure the way this works and pricing)

        - Q: _“How can you deliver so fast?”_ – A: Because we’ve **streamlined the process**. We start with your knowledge (no wasted time), use efficient tools (AI-assisted coding, etc.), and focus on core features first. Also we work **iteratively** – you see progress in days.
            
        - Q: _“What does ‘unlimited requests’ really mean?”_ – A: Exactly that – request as many features or designs as you want. We tackle them one or two at a time to maintain quality[awesomic.com](https://www.awesomic.com/blog/unlimited-development-subscription-why-is-it-worth-it-for-scaleups-and-enterprises#:~:text=The%20core%20advantage%20of%20this,another%20subscription%20increases%20the%20number). You’ll never be charged more for asking for extra work in a given month; it’s all included. (We’ll be transparent about realistic timelines for larger requests.)
            
        - Q: _“Can you work with our existing team?”_ – A: Absolutely. We can act as an extra team member, focusing on front-end or prototypes while your team does other work. Or we can take a whole project off their plate. We play nice with developers – our code is clean and maintainable (we can even involve your devs early to ensure a smooth handover if needed).
            
        - Q: _“What if I just need design or just development?”_ – A: That’s fine too. Our front-end plan is essentially **design in code** – perfect if you only require UX/UI help. If you have designs and need them built, we can do dev only as well. The model is flexible: you’re subscribing to get outcomes (designs or features built), not to employ a person 40hrs/week.
            
        - Q: _“Is there a commitment?”_ – A: No long-term contracts. **Month-to-month, cancel any time**[hatchwise.com](https://www.hatchwise.com/resources/an-honest-review-of-designjoy-design-agency#:~:text=,Pause%20or%20cancel%20anytime). Some clients engage for 1-2 months to kickstart a project; others stick around for continuous growth. It’s up to you.
