# About Zebra Design

**Design & Code, On-Demand** - From designers that code with AI

[Zebra Design](https://zebradesign.io/) is my solo practice where I blend design thinking with AI-powered development to help innovators launch sooner and learn faster.

## What I Do

I design and build digital products through an AI-powered, user-focused partnership. Working directly with startup founders, SMEs, and teams needing more runway, I deliver:

- **Full-stack development** - Front-end and back-end, not just pretty prototypes
- **2-4 week launches** - Instead of waiting months for traditional teams
- **Built-in user testing** - Every cycle includes validation to de-risk ideas
- **Monthly flat fee** - Starting ~â‚¬5k, cancel anytime

## My Background

After co-founding Deep Work Studio (delivered UX for Ethereum, MakerDAO, and other Web3 innovators), I saw how traditional design handoffs slowed development. In 2025, I embraced AI-assisted coding and discovered a better way: design and development unified from the start.

### Notable Work
- **Ramp Network** - Product I designed helped raise $120M
- **Nexus Mutual** - Platform manages $200M+ coverage
- **Ethereum Foundation** - Designed Eth2.0 staking interface, transitioned billions

## The Zebra Process

1. **Workshops** - Align on goals and user needs
2. **Design & Build** - Rapid prototyping with AI assistance
3. **Test & Iterate** - User validation built into every cycle
4. **Launch & Learn** - Ship fast, gather feedback, improve

## Recent AI-Built Projects

- **Therapist AI Tool** - Call transcription with AI-generated hints (1 week build)
- **Waitlist Platform** - Capture early adopters for any product (2 days)
- **Sunni Photo Concept** - My first AI project exploring databases (2 weeks)

## Philosophy

> "Ship fast. Test with users. Iterate quickly. That's how I help you launch products that succeed."

I'm obsessed with making product development faster and more user-centric. Yes, I love beautiful design, but I love real-world results even more.
