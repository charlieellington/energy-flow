# Zebra Design Pricing Model

## Monthly Subscription ~€5,000

**Cancel anytime. No long-term contracts.**

## Value-Based Pricing Philosophy

Fair pricing at ~20% of the value delivered to your business over 2 years. 

**Example**: If our work adds €500k to your bottom line, you pay about €8k/month.

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Monthly Cost | Additional Considerations |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Zebra Design** | ~€5k/month | Ship 4× faster, cancel anytime |
| **In-house team** | €20k/month | + 3 months recruiting |
| **Traditional agency** | €20k-€40k/month | + change orders, slower turnaround |

That's **1/4 the cost** of a typical team – and you'll **ship 4× faster**.
