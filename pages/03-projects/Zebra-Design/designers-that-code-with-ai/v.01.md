Great. I'll now create a step-by-step implementation plan to adapt the Lume Studio Next.js template into a one-page Zebra Design website using your finalised copy and progressive disclosure layout. We'll preserve the original template structure to minimise customisation, with pricing linked to a standalone page and case studies linking to external URLs. This will help you launch quickly and iterate live.

Zebra Design
============

*Designers that code with AI*

I help you launch your digital product faster through a user-focused partnership. For startup founders, small-to-medium businesses, and product teams, my design-as-a-service model rapidly turns your **idea** into a tested **product** in weeks, not months. I handle both **design and development** to get your app up and running lightning fast.

Typical Approaches:
-------------------

-   **"6-month dev estimates turning into 12-month nightmares":** I avoid this entirely. Using AI and Cursor, I build user-centric MVPs in weeks, not months.

-   **"Designs that don't match what developers build":** My decade of experience launching early-stage products (as a freelancer and as founder of Deep Work) means I know how to tightly integrate design with development. Ramp Network raised $120 million on a product I designed, Ethereum launched its Eth 2.0 staking through an interface I crafted, and Nexus Mutual---now a leader in web3 insurance---runs on a platform I helped design. These are all examples of seamless design-to-development execution.

-   **"Freelancers who disappear or get priorities wrong":** I've been a startup founder myself, launching three different companies. I understand your needs and what actually matters when bringing a product to market---speed and continuous user feedback. You'll never have to worry about misaligned priorities or a freelancer ghosting you.

-   **"Burning cash without validated learning":** At Deep Work Studio (my last design agency), I perfected an early prototype testing model. This scientific, rapid design process delivers validated designs in weeks instead of months, so you won't waste time or money on unproven ideas.

A Different Approach Using AI Coding: Design and Code, Unified. Product and Users First.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I start by running a rapid design sprint with your team and domain experts. Next, I build your prototype **directly in code** (not just static mockups) and test it with real users---all within a few weeks. From there, I act as your on-call product team, continuously delivering new features on a subscription model. **No more delays or runaway costs.**

What to Expect:
---------------

1.  **Workshops:** We kick off with collaborative workshops to rapidly align all stakeholders and domain experts in the design process. No more tedious feedback loops or miscommunications---everyone gains a clear understanding of the problem and goals from day one.

2.  **Prototype in Code:** I design a high-fidelity UI and build the front-end in real code---this interactive prototype is the first version of your actual product. You'll have your initial MVP in days, not months, so we can start gathering feedback immediately.

3.  **User Testing:** I conduct rapid user tests on the MVP to gather real feedback. No more spending months building the wrong thing---every decision for subsequent development is driven by what real users need and validate.

4.  **Continuous Build:** I implement the feedback and continue developing the product (connecting the backend, polishing the UI, etc.), all with the same user-centric design-to-code approach. On an ongoing basis, I add features on demand through your subscription---your product keeps evolving continuously, without missing a beat.
