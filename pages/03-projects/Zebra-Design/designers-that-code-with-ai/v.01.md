A Different Approach Using AI Coding: Design and Code, Unified. Product and Users First.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I start by running a rapid design sprint with your team and domain experts. Next, I build your prototype **directly in code** (not just static mockups) and test it with real users---all within a few weeks. From there, I act as your on-call product team, continuously delivering new features on a subscription model. **No more delays or runaway costs.**

What to Expect:
---------------

1.  **Workshops:** We kick off with collaborative workshops to rapidly align all stakeholders and domain experts in the design process. No more tedious feedback loops or miscommunications---everyone gains a clear understanding of the problem and goals from day one.

2.  **Prototype in Code:** I design a high-fidelity UI and build the front-end in real code---this interactive prototype is the first version of your actual product. You'll have your initial MVP in days, not months, so we can start gathering feedback immediately.

3.  **User Testing:** I conduct rapid user tests on the MVP to gather real feedback. No more spending months building the wrong thing---every decision for subsequent development is driven by what real users need and validate.

4.  **Continuous Build:** I implement the feedback and continue developing the product (connecting the backend, polishing the UI, etc.), all with the same user-centric design-to-code approach. On an ongoing basis, I add features on demand through your subscription---your product keeps evolving continuously, without missing a beat.
