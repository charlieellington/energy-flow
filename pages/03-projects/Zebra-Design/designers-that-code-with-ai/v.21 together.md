# Launch in Weeks, Not Months

Zebra Design gets you from idea to **user-tested product** in a matter of weeks, not months. We design **and** code your app simultaneously for lightning-fast delivery, without sacrificing user feedback or quality. 

1.  **Workshops with domain experts ▸**\
     Rapid workshops get your whole team aligned---no endless feedback loops.\
     *I run as many as needed to capture knowledge and map user goals.*

2.  **Prototype in real code ▸**\
     High‑fidelity UI coded in days, not months. It's the first working version, not a mock‑up.

3.  **User testing built‑in ▸**\
     I test the MVP with real users, so we learn before we burn budget.

4.  **Continuous build: Request <> Receive ▸**\
     With real feedback in hand, we iterate and build out your product continuously. Through our monthly subscription, we act as your on-call product team – refining the UX, adding features, and hooking up the back-end as needed to evolve your product.

How we overcome your typical product issues without hiring in house: 

-  **"**12‑month nightmare dev timelines ":** 
- **Designers that code with AI** ▸\  I avoid this entirely. Using AI and Cursor, I build user-centric MVPs in weeks, not months. I've spent all of 2025 using these new tools and iterating on processes to be confident to offer my design first AI coding skills as a service. 

-   **"**Design vs dev mismatch":** 
  - **I have over a decade of experience launching early-stage products** ▸\ (as a freelancer and as founder of Deep Work) means I know how to tightly integrate design with development. Ramp Network raised $120 million on a product I designed, Ethereum launched its Eth 2.0 staking through an interface I crafted, and Nexus Mutual---now a leader in web3 insurance---runs on a platform I design before web3 experiences were a thing. These are all examples of seamless design-to-development execution.

-   **"Freelancers without priorities":** 
- **I understand your needs as a startup founder** ▸\ I've been a startup founder myself, launching three different companies. I understand your needs and what actually matters when bringing a product to market---speed and continuous user feedback. You'll never have to worry about misaligned priorities or a freelancer dragging out chargeable days. 

-   **"Burning cash without users or validation":** 
- **Process based on Google Venture's Design Sprints and seven years of working with early stage tech teams.** ▸\ At Deep Work Studio (my last design agency), we perfected an early prototype testing model. This scientific, rapid design process delivers validated designs in weeks instead of months, so you won't waste time or money on unproven ideas.

## Who I Help 

*I'm **Charlie Ellington**---product designer turned full‑stack maker. I ran Deep Work Studio and crafted UX for MakerDAO, Ethereum, Ramp, and Nexus Mutual. After discovering AI‑assisted coding, I realised I could merge design + build and slash time‑to‑market for founders like you. Zebra Design is my solo practice---no middle managers; you work directly with me.* 

-   Founders racing to validate an idea before the runway runs out.
-   Product teams missing design / front‑end velocity.
-   SMEs needing a bespoke internal tool without hiring engineers.
-   MVP owners who need a UX overhaul and features *now*.
-   Anyone burned by flaky freelancers or over‑priced agencies.
