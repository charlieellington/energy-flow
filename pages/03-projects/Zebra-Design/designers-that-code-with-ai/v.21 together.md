# Launch in Weeks, Not Months

Zebra Design gets you from idea to **user-tested product** in a matter of weeks, not months. We design **and** code your app simultaneously for lightning-fast delivery, without sacrificing user feedback or quality. 

1.  **Workshops with domain experts ▸**\
     Rapid workshops get your whole team aligned---no endless feedback loops.\
     *I run as many as needed to capture knowledge and map user goals.*

2.  **Prototype in real code ▸**\
     High‑fidelity UI coded in days, not months. It's the first working version, not a mock‑up.

3.  **User testing built‑in ▸**\
     I test the MVP with real users, so we learn before we burn budget.

4.  **Continuous build: Request <> Recieve ▸**\
     With real feedback in hand, we iterate and build out your product continuously. Through our monthly subscription, we act as your on-call product team – refining the UX, adding features, and hooking up the back-end as needed to evolve your product.

How we overcome your typical product issues without hiring in house: 

-  **"**12‑month nightmare dev timelines ":** 
- **Designers that code with AI** ▸\  I avoid this entirely. Using AI and Cursor, I build user-centric MVPs in weeks, not months. I've spent all of 2025 using these new tools and iterating on processes to be confident to offer my design first AI coding skills as a service. 

-   **"**Design vs dev mismatch":** 
  - **I have over a decade of experience launching early-stage products** ▸\ (as a freelancer and as founder of Deep Work) means I know how to tightly integrate design with development. Ramp Network raised $120 million on a product I designed, Ethereum launched its Eth 2.0 staking through an interface I crafted, and Nexus Mutual---now a leader in web3 insurance---runs on a platform I design before web3 experiences were a thing. These are all examples of seamless design-to-development execution.

-   **"Freelancers without priorities":** 
- **I understand your needs as a startup founder** ▸\ I've been a startup founder myself, launching three different companies. I understand your needs and what actually matters when bringing a product to market---speed and continuous user feedback. You'll never have to worry about misaligned priorities or a freelancer dragging out chargeable days. 

-   **"Burning cash without users or validation":** 
- **Process based on Google Venture's Design Sprints and seven years of working with early stage tech teams.** ▸\ At Deep Work Studio (my last design agency), we perfected an early prototype testing model. This scientific, rapid design process delivers validated designs in weeks instead of months, so you won't waste time or money on unproven ideas.

**Pricing page**

We offer a straightforward **monthly subscription** for our design+development service. It’s a flat fee that gives you a dedicated, on-call product team. **Plans start at approximately €5,000 per month** for a standard engagement, which includes unlimited design/development requests (one task at a time, handled with high quality focus. If you need to accelerate more, you can scale up with additional parallel workstreams (similar to adding another “subscription” for a second simultaneous task). 

**No long-term contract** – it’s strictly month-to-month, **cancel any time**. Think of it like an agile sprint: you pay for a month, we deliver as much value as possible in that time. You can renew, pause, or stop based on your needs. We’ll even help estimate how many months or cycles you might need to reach your goals, so you have a clear roadmap from the start. And of course, if priorities change, you’re never locked in – our model is as flexible as your startup needs to be.

**Calculating the monthly fee**

**“Hire us to get the job done, risk-free:** We structure our pricing around the _value and outcomes_ we deliver to your business. Instead of paying for endless hours or features you don’t need, you invest a fixed monthly amount aligned with the results you’re after. If we estimate our work will add roughly €500k to your bottom line in two years, your cost would be about €8k per month for one year – a **small fraction** of that value.



We offer a flexible monthly subscription model with three plan tiers to fit your needs:

- **UI/UX Design Only** – We design your product’s interface _in code_ and deliver a polished front-end using modern UI libraries. Perfect if you only need UX/UI design and a clickable front-end prototype.
    
- **Front-End Development** – Custom design **plus** a front-end application built in Cursor, our AI-assisted development environment. We’ll create your UX/UI and code a front-end app (documented in Storybook or using the shadcn component library) ready to plug into your backend.
    
- **Full-Stack Development** – A complete end-to-end product. We design the UI and build the entire application in Cursor, including front-end and back-end development, delivering a fully functional app.
    

**Pricing & Terms:** Plans start at approximately **€5k per month**. We typically price at about **20% of the projected value** we’ll deliver to your business over 2 years. (For example, if our solution is estimated to save you around €500k in two years, the subscription would be roughly €8k per month.) All plans are **no long-term lock-in** – you can cancel at any time. If you do choose to end the engagement early, we only charge a modest **20% wrap-up fee** on the remaining contract value (following the agile “Money for Nothing” principle, to fairly cover the unused work). In short: we succeed when you succeed, and we’re confident in delivering value far above our cost.

If we estimate our work will add roughly €500k to your bottom line in two years, your cost would be about €8k per month for one year – a **small fraction** of that value. And here’s the best part: **you’re free to cancel anytime**. Once you’ve gotten what you need (your new product features are live and bringing in revenue, or your team is ready to take over), you can stop the engagement. You’ll only pay a small wrap-up fee (20% of the remaining contract), and you keep all the benefits delivered so far. This means we’re motivated to deliver meaningful results from month one, and you never pay for work that isn’t moving you closer to your goals. It’s a win-win: you get value early and often, and you have the flexibility to scale down when you’re satisfied.”*
