## About Us

**Founder-led, Design-centric, Outcome-driven.** Zebra Design was founded by a veteran product designer with 10+ years of experience launching early-stage products. After co-founding Deep Work Studio (a design agency that delivered successful UX for Web3 innovators like Ethereum, MakerDAO and others), our founder saw how traditional design handoffs often slowed development to a crawl. In 2023–24 he embraced AI-assisted coding and discovered a better way to build products: **design and development unified from the start** for ultra-fast results.

Today, Zebra Design is a small but mighty team that blends design thinking, coding expertise, and cutting-edge AI tools. We are obsessed with making product development **faster and more user-centric**. We act as your hands-on partner with skin in the game – when **you** succeed, **we** succeed. Our mission is simple: help innovators launch sooner and learn faster. Yes, we love beautiful design, but we love real-world results even more.
