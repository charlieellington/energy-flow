# Launch in Weeks, Not Months

Zebra Design gets you from idea to **user-tested product** in a matter of weeks, not months. We design **and** code your app simultaneously for lightning-fast delivery, without sacrificing user feedback or quality.

## How It Works (Our Process)

**Rapid 4-Step Product Build:** We combine design and development into one fast, iterative cycle:

1. **Workshop:** We start with a rapid kickoff workshop to align on your goals and capture your team’s knowledge from day one.
    
2. **Prototype in Code:** Next, we design the UI and build a high-fidelity front-end prototype in working code _within days_. This isn’t a throwaway mockup – it’s the first version of your product.
    
3. **User Testing:** We quickly put the prototype in front of real users to gather feedback. Each iteration is informed by users, so you won’t waste time or money building the wrong thing.
    
4. **Continuous Build:** With real feedback in hand, we iterate and build out your product continuously. Through our monthly subscription, we act as your on-call product team – refining the UX, adding features, and hooking up the back-end as needed to evolve your product.
    

## Key Benefits

- **Speed:** Go from idea to a clickable, working product in 2–4 weeks. We move at breakneck speed to get a usable app in front of your users ASAP.
    
- **Validated Results:** Every cycle includes user testing, so you know each iteration hits the mark before doubling down. It’s built-in validation to de-risk your big ideas.
    
- **Clear Pricing:** One flat monthly fee covers **all** design and development – no hourly rates or surprise change orders. Unlimited requests (handled one at a time for quality). Plus, you can pause or cancel whenever you need.
    
- **Quality Design:** Enjoy beautiful, consistent UI using proven libraries and design systems. We prioritise a great user experience and fast delivery over any ego-driven from-scratch designs that slow you down.
    
- **Full-Stack Capability:** Need a backend or integrations? No problem. We handle front-end **and** back-end development as needed to deliver a complete, working product – not just a pretty prototype.
    
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Our collaborative process involves your team from the start. Through workshops and frequent check-ins, everyone stays on the same page. No more design-dev ping-pong or miscommunications slowing progress.
    

## Who It’s For

- **Startup founders** – who need to test a new app idea _ASAP_ to find product–market fit before the runway runs out. (We provide the speed and lean iteration to do exactly that.)
    
- **Product teams with developers** – who have engineering talent but lack UX/UI bandwidth. We’ll slot in as your design & front-end experts, rapidly shaping your product’s interface and even integrating with your backend.
    
- **SMEs and non-tech businesses** – that need a custom internal tool or app built from scratch (and don’t have an in-house design or dev team). We design and build your solution end-to-end, fast.
    
- **Teams with an MVP** – who have a bare-bones product that users find clunky or limited. We can overhaul your UX/UI and quickly add the features users are asking for to level up your product.
    
- **Companies stuck in limbo** – after freelancers or agencies have let you down with delays, miscommunication, or lack of accountability. Our integrated approach gets your product moving forward again with weekly visible progress.
    

## Project Examples

**Recent rapid builds (last 3 months):**

- **IFS Internal Tool:** A custom finance system app developed in days using AI-assisted coding.
    
- **Waitlist Platform:** A full-featured waitlist and sign-up web app spun up in under a week to validate a new startup idea.
    
- **“Sunni” Concept App:** An AI-driven concept mobile app created from scratch to showcase how quickly we go from concept to working code.
    

_(Before Zebra Design, our founder led design for top Web3 products at Deep Work Studio – including projects for **MakerDAO**, **Ethereum 2.0** (staking launchpad), **Ramp** (whose product design helped raise $120M), and **Nexus Mutual**. We’ve taken those fast, user-focused design principles and merged them with code.)_

## Pricing

We offer a flexible monthly subscription model with three plan tiers to fit your needs:

- **UI/UX Design Only** – We design your product’s interface _in code_ and deliver a polished front-end using modern UI libraries. Perfect if you only need UX/UI design and a clickable front-end prototype.
    
- **Front-End Development** – Custom design **plus** a front-end application built in Cursor, our AI-assisted development environment. We’ll create your UX/UI and code a front-end app (documented in Storybook or using the shadcn component library) ready to plug into your backend.
    
- **Full-Stack Development** – A complete end-to-end product. We design the UI and build the entire application in Cursor, including front-end and back-end development, delivering a fully functional app.
    

**Pricing & Terms:** Plans start at approximately **€5k per month**. We typically price at about **20% of the projected value** we’ll deliver to your business over 2 years. (For example, if our solution is estimated to save you around €500k in two years, the subscription would be roughly €8k per month.) All plans are **no long-term lock-in** – you can cancel at any time. If you do choose to end the engagement early, we only charge a modest **20% wrap-up fee** on the remaining contract value (following the agile “Money for Nothing” principle, to fairly cover the unused work). In short: we succeed when you succeed, and we’re confident in delivering value far above our cost.

## FAQs

**How can you deliver so fast?**  
We’ve honed an ultra-streamlined process. From day one we leverage your team’s existing knowledge (instead of weeks of slow “discovery”), then we use efficient tools like AI coding assistants and pre-built components. By focusing only on what matters for the user and building in code immediately (no throwaway mockups), we compress the timeline dramatically without cutting corners. The result is high-quality output at breakneck speed.

**What does “unlimited requests” really mean?**  
Exactly what it sounds like – you can request as many features, design tweaks, or tasks as you want each month. We’ll handle them one at a time with laser focus to maintain quality. You can continually prioritise your backlog, and we’ll keep delivering tasks in order of importance. There’s effectively no cap on the amount of work; we just make sure each item is done right before moving to the next.

**Can you work with our existing team?**  
Absolutely. Think of us as an extension of your team – a special forces unit that plugs right in. If you have in-house developers, we’ll collaborate with them (for example, we can consume your existing API or work alongside your back-end engineers). If you have a product manager or designer, we’ll sync up to ensure our work complements yours. We play nice with any stack or team; our goal is to enhance your capabilities, not duplicate or disrupt them.

**What if I just need design or just development?**  
That’s fine too! We’re flexible. If you only need design, we offer a **design-in-code** plan where we craft your UX/UI in live code and deliver an interactive front-end for your developers to plug into. Conversely, if you already have designs and just need them built out, we can go into **dev-only mode** – turning your existing design files into a working product. Our subscription adapts to what you need: you’re hiring us to achieve outcomes (finished designs, coded features), not to fill a timesheet.

**Is there a commitment?**  
No long-term commitment required. Our standard engagement is month-to-month — use us for as long (or as short) as you need. You can cancel anytime. If you’re on a multi-month plan or decide to stop mid-project, you’re free to do so; we’d just charge a 20% wrap-up fee on the remaining work as a courtesy (this follows agile’s “cancel anytime” ethos with a fair compensation for unused time). Many clients start with a one-month pilot to see the value first-hand. If you love the results, you can simply continue; if not, you can stop with no hard feelings.

## About Us

**Founder-led, Design-centric, Outcome-driven.** Zebra Design was founded by a veteran product designer with 10+ years of experience launching early-stage products. After co-founding Deep Work Studio (a design agency that delivered successful UX for Web3 innovators like Ethereum, MakerDAO and others), our founder saw how traditional design handoffs often slowed development to a crawl. In 2023–24 he embraced AI-assisted coding and discovered a better way to build products: **design and development unified from the start** for ultra-fast results.

Today, Zebra Design is a small but mighty team that blends design thinking, coding expertise, and cutting-edge AI tools. We are obsessed with making product development **faster and more user-centric**. We act as your hands-on partner with skin in the game – when **you** succeed, **we** succeed. Our mission is simple: help innovators launch sooner and learn faster. Yes, we love beautiful design, but we love real-world results even more.
