6 Pricing (tabs / cards -- one open by default)
----------------------------------------------

**Headline:** *Value‑based, month‑to‑month. Starts ~€5 k.*\
*Sub‑copy:* "You pay ~20 % of the value I create over two years. Cancel anytime---only a 20 % wrap‑up fee on the remaining balance (Agile 'Money for Nothing')."

| Tier | Short pitch | Typical fit | Example cost* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **UI/UX Design Only** | Design in code. Pixel‑perfect front‑end using a UI library. | Teams with back‑end devs in place. | from **€5 k / m** |
| **Front‑End** | Custom design + coded front‑end app (Storybook / shadcn). | SaaS founders who need UI + build. | from **€7 k / m** |
| **Full‑Stack** | Complete app (front‑ & back‑end) built in Cursor. | Zero‑to‑one product build. | from **€9 k / m** |

*If I project €500 k benefit over two years, Full‑Stack lands ~€8 k / m.\
*Select a tier to expand full inclusions & FAQs.*

Expandable block inside each card:

> **What's inside?** Unlimited queued tasks, weekly progress demos, async Slack/Linear comms, code repo, CI/CD.\
> **Cancellation:** Stop anytime → pay 20 % of remaining months. Keeps us both honest and incentivises front‑loaded value.

10 About Me
-----------

*I'm **Charlie Ellington**---product designer turned full‑stack maker. I ran Deep Work Studio and crafted UX for MakerDAO, Ethereum, Ramp, and Nexus Mutual. After discovering AI‑assisted coding, I realised I could merge design + build and slash time‑to‑market for founders like you. Zebra Design is my solo practice---no middle managers; you work directly with me.*
