Below is a **plain‑text site outline** ready to hand to a developer.\
- **ALL headlines** double as accordion / hover cards on mobile / desktop (progressive‑disclosure).\
- Copy is in **first person** (Charlie Ellington).\
- Nothing from the previous draft is lost---only tightened or re‑ordered for best‑practice flow.\
- Use **▸ / ▾** (or "+ / --") to indicate collapsed / expanded on mobile; on desktop you can default‑open the first item in each group or reveal on hover.\
- Sections are numbered for clarity---delete the numbers when coding.

4 My Process (accordion)
------------------------

1.  **Workshops with domain experts ▸**\
     Rapid workshops get your whole team aligned---no endless feedback loops.\
     *I run as many as needed to capture knowledge and map user goals.*

2.  **Prototype in real code ▸**\
     High‑fidelity UI coded in days, not months. It's the first working version, not a mock‑up.

3.  **User testing built‑in ▸**\
     I test the MVP with real users, so we learn before we burn budget.

4.  **Continuous build ▸**\
     Feedback goes straight into design‑in‑code iterations. Need new features? Just queue them---your subscription covers it.

* * * * *

5 Typical Pain Points (accordion, collapsed by default)
-------------------------------------------------------

-   **12‑month nightmare dev timelines ▸**\
     With AI + Cursor I ship MVPs in weeks.

-   **Design vs dev mismatch ▸**\
     I've shipped for Ramp (raised €120 M), Ethereum 2.0 staking, Nexus Mutual---design vision *meets* code.

-   **Freelancers disappear ▸**\
     I've founded three startups; I know speed & accountability matter.

-   **Burning cash without validation ▸**\
     My Deep Work days proved the power of scientific, test‑first design. I now bring that rigor straight into code.

6 Pricing (tabs / cards -- one open by default)
----------------------------------------------

**Headline:** *Value‑based, month‑to‑month. Starts ~€5 k.*\
*Sub‑copy:* "You pay ~20 % of the value I create over two years. Cancel anytime---only a 20 % wrap‑up fee on the remaining balance (Agile 'Money for Nothing')."

| Tier | Short pitch | Typical fit | Example cost* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **UI/UX Design Only** | Design in code. Pixel‑perfect front‑end using a UI library. | Teams with back‑end devs in place. | from **€5 k / m** |
| **Front‑End** | Custom design + coded front‑end app (Storybook / shadcn). | SaaS founders who need UI + build. | from **€7 k / m** |
| **Full‑Stack** | Complete app (front‑ & back‑end) built in Cursor. | Zero‑to‑one product build. | from **€9 k / m** |

*If I project €500 k benefit over two years, Full‑Stack lands ~€8 k / m.\
*Select a tier to expand full inclusions & FAQs.*

Expandable block inside each card:

> **What's inside?** Unlimited queued tasks, weekly progress demos, async Slack/Linear comms, code repo, CI/CD.\
> **Cancellation:** Stop anytime → pay 20 % of remaining months. Keeps us both honest and incentivises front‑loaded value.

10 About Me
-----------

*I'm **Charlie Ellington**---product designer turned full‑stack maker. I ran Deep Work Studio and crafted UX for MakerDAO, Ethereum, Ramp, and Nexus Mutual. After discovering AI‑assisted coding, I realised I could merge design + build and slash time‑to‑market for founders like you. Zebra Design is my solo practice---no middle managers; you work directly with me.*
