**Pricing page**

We offer a straightforward **monthly subscription** for our design+development service. It’s a flat fee that gives you a dedicated, on-call product team. **Plans start at approximately €5,000 per month** for a standard engagement, which includes unlimited design/development requests (one task at a time, handled with high quality focus. If you need to accelerate more, you can scale up with additional parallel workstreams (similar to adding another “subscription” for a second simultaneous task). 

**No long-term contract** – it’s strictly month-to-month, **cancel any time**. Think of it like an agile sprint: you pay for a month, we deliver as much value as possible in that time. You can renew, pause, or stop based on your needs. We’ll even help estimate how many months or cycles you might need to reach your goals, so you have a clear roadmap from the start. And of course, if priorities change, you’re never locked in – our model is as flexible as your startup needs to be.

**Calculating the monthly fee**

**“Hire us to get the job done, risk-free:** We structure our pricing around the _value and outcomes_ we deliver to your business. Instead of paying for endless hours or features you don’t need, you invest a fixed monthly amount aligned with the results you’re after. If we estimate our work will add roughly €500k to your bottom line in two years, your cost would be about 20% of that over one year of our work or: €8k per month for one year – a **small fraction** of that value.

Example 1: 
Value Calculation: 
We save on your team costs by creating an application for onboarding your customers: it frees up 10% of your team times and increases revenue by 20% - €300k value over two years. 
Our Fee: 
€300k x 20% = €60k 
over 12 months = €5k our fee per month 

Example 2: 
We take a workflow out of your development teams hands (one PM, one designer and two developers) costing €420k over a year 
Our Fee: 
€400k x 20% = €84k 
over 12 months = €7k our fee per month 

****

And here’s the best part: **you’re free to cancel anytime**. Once you’ve gotten what you need (your new product features are live and bringing in revenue, or your team is ready to take over), you can stop the engagement. 

You’ll only pay a small wrap-up fee (20% of the remaining year), and you keep all the benefits delivered so far. This means we’re motivated to deliver meaningful results from month one, and you never pay for work that isn’t moving you closer to your goals. It’s a win-win: you get value early and often, and you have the flexibility to scale down when you’re satisfied.”*
