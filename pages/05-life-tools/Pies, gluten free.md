### Gluten‑free Cornish‑pasty Style Pies

_(Makes about 8 hand‑sized pasties – 4 ham‑and‑cheese, 4 spinach‑feta)_

---

#### A. Short‑crust pastry

1. **Dry blend** – Tip **120 g sorghum flour**, **60 g almond flour**, **40 g tapioca starch**, **1 ½ tsp psyllium husk**, **½ tsp fine salt** (and, if you keep it, **¼ tsp xanthan gum**) into a mixing bowl and whisk.
    
2. **Work in fat** – Drop in **110 g fridge‑cold, diced butter** and rub until the mix looks like coarse breadcrumbs with a few pea‑sized bits left.
    
3. **Bind** – Crack **1 large egg** into the bowl and stir. Splash in **½ tsp cider vinegar** and then **3 tbsp ice‑cold water**, one spoon at a time, just until the dough clumps. Add up to **2 tbsp more water** if it still feels floury.
    
4. **Rest** – Press the dough into a disc, wrap, and chill for **30 minutes** so the psyllium hydrates and the butter firms.

#### B. Ham & Cheese filling (makes 4 pasties)

5. **Soften aromatics** – Melt a knob of butter in a pan, add **1 small leek, finely sliced**, and cook on low for **5 minutes** until silky. Let it cool.
    
6. **Mix** – In a bowl combine the cooled leek, **150 g diced cooked ham**, **120 g grated mature Cheddar** (or Emmental), **2 tbsp crème fraîche**, plus a **pinch of nutmeg** and **a few twists of black pepper**.

#### C. Spinach‑feta filling (makes 4 pasties)

7. **Wilt greens** – Drop **250 g fresh spinach** into a hot dry pan, toss for **1–2 minutes** until collapsed, then tip into a sieve and squeeze hard; you need it almost dry.
    
8. **Combine** – Stir the spinach with **150 g feta, crumbled**, **1 small onion, finely sautéed and cooled**, **1 beaten egg**, **zest of ½ lemon**, **½ tsp dried oregano**, and **black pepper to taste**.

#### D. Forming the pasties

9. **Roll** – On a floured sheet of baking paper, roll the chilled dough to **3 mm** thick. Cut circles roughly **18 cm** across (a soup bowl is a handy guide). Re‑roll scraps once.
    
10. **Fill** – Place about **⅓ cup (80 g)** of ham mixture on one half of four circles. Repeat with the spinach mix on the remaining circles. Leave a **2 cm** clean rim.
    
11. **Seal** – Brush the rims with a little beaten egg (borrow from the fridge stash), fold the pastry over, press to seal, and crimp the edge firmly.
    
12. **Vent & glaze** – Snip a tiny steam hole in each pasty and brush the tops with more beaten egg.

#### E. Bake

13. **Oven on** – Heat to **200 °C** (fan **180 °C**).
    
14. **Bake** – Slide the pasties onto a parchment‑lined tray and bake for **25–30 minutes** until deep golden and the bases feel crisp.
    

Eat hot, or cool and freeze. To cook from frozen, bake at the same temperature for about **40 minutes**, covering with foil for the final ten if the crust browns too quickly.
