### Equipment checklist

- Large mixing bowl
    
- Sturdy spoon or mixer with dough hook
    
- Digital scales
    
- Six small lidded tubs or oiled bowls
    
- Baking parchment sheets
    
- Heavy baking tray (kept upside-down in the oven)
    
- Conventional oven that reaches 270 °C / fan 250 °C

### Method

1. **Combine wet and dry (5 min)**
    
    - Tip the entire dry mix into the thickened psyllium gel.
        
    - Beat hard for 2 – 3 min until the dough forms a soft, smooth ball that cleans the bowl.
        
2. **First rise (45 – 60 min)**
    
    - Cover the bowl. Leave at room temperature (about 26 °C) until the dough has puffed by roughly half.
        
3. **Divide and chill**
    
    - Weigh the dough; divide by six. Roll each piece into a tight ball with lightly oiled hands.
        
    - Pop each ball into a lightly oiled, lidded tub (or cover with cling film).
        
    - Refrigerate for up to **8 hours** while you prep toppings or start the party.
        
4. **Heat the oven**
    
    - Set it to its hottest regular setting — **270 °C conventional** or **250 °C fan**.
        
    - Place an up-turned heavy tray on the middle shelf to mimic a pizza stone. Heat for **20 min**.
        
5. **Press and shape each base**
    
    - Remove one dough ball **20 min before baking** so it loses the chill.
        
    - Place it on a sheet of baking parchment. Drizzle or mist a little olive oil over dough and fingertips.
        
    - Press from the centre outward, working fast and light, until the middle is c. 3 mm thick with a thicker rim.
        
    - If it sticks, dust with **½ tsp tapioca starch**, wait 30 s, then continue.
        
    - Leave the shaped base on its parchment; that sheet becomes your “peel”.
        
6. **Bake workflow — single-tray rhythm**
    

|Clock|Action|Oven|
|---|---|---|
|0:00|Slide first base (with parchment) onto hot tray — **par-bake**|6 min|
|0:06|Remove, add toppings; put back to **finish**|7 – 9 min|
|0:13|While first pizza finishes, slide in second base to **par-bake**|—|
|0:19|Serve first pizza, top second; par-bake third|—|

_Keep leap-frogging: every par-baked blank comes out, you top it while the previous pizza finishes, then it goes back in. No raw base ever sits waiting._

7. **Serve hot**
    
    - Rest each pizza 2 min for the cheese to settle, then slice and hand round. Carry on until the tubs are empty.

### Sticky-dough survival kit

- **Oil beats flour** — light film on hands, dough, and parchment.
    
- **Fast, gentle presses** — stretching slowly invites tearing; quick taps coax it wider.
    
- **Tiny starch dustings** — ½ tsp tapioca absorbs surface moisture without toughening the bake.

### Overnight option

Need to mix the night before? Drop yeast to **9 g** total. Refrigerate the dough straight after mixing. Next day, pull balls 30 min before shaping; everything else stays the same.
