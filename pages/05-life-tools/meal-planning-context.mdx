# Meal Planning Context

## Bene & Charlie — Meal-Plan Context Guide  
*(Copy this whole block when briefing any AI to design our weekly meals)*

---

### 1 Household Snapshot
| Person | Key notes |
|--------|-----------|
| **Bene** | Pregnant (9 weeks). Mild reflux (avoid heavy sauces). Needs folate, iron, calcium, steady protein, omega-3 (limit to **one fish meal/week**). |
| **Charlie** | Gut-healing: strictly GF, very low dairy/sugar, prefers cooked veg. Daily pumpkin seeds + raw garlic. Aims for weight-loss via light breakfasts. |

---

### 2 Non-Negotiable Diet Rules
* 100 % **gluten-free**  
* Dairy only as coconut yoghurt or minimal butter  
* Only low-mercury, fully-cooked fish  
* Avoid heavy coconut/tomato sauces (reflux)  
* Daily cooked greens — **broccoli** mandatory  
* Herbs, garlic, cumin, turmeric welcome  
* Pumpkin seeds + raw garlic every day  
* Fruit capped at berries or 1 tbsp stewed apple

### 3 Meal Pattern We Like
| Slot | Typical food | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Breakfast | • Chia bowl (almond milk + coconut yoghurt + seeds) **or**• Eggs & avocado + side salad | Light, quick, fibre-rich |
| Lunch | Always **leftovers** from last dinner | Zero prep |
| Dinner | One big cook (tray-bake / one-pot) ⇒ creates next-day lunch | Cuts effort |

★ One breakfast each day is deliberately “lighter” for Charlie’s weight goal.

### 4 Weekly Structure
* **4-day plan** (Mon–Thu) to minimise spoilage  
* Exactly **1 fish dinner** + **1 meat dinner** (not always meatballs) + **2 plant dinners**  
* Include a small **mid-week top-up** list for fresh produce  

Suggested flow:  
1️⃣ Mon – Fresh fish tray-bake  
2️⃣ Tue – Plant dish (e.g. quinoa-pepper bake + roasted chickpeas)  
3️⃣ Wed – Meat tray-bake (e.g. herb roast chicken thighs)  
4️⃣ Thu – Plant fritters/hash or lentil-based solid dish  

---

### 5 Staple Batch-Cook Snacks
* **Roasted Chickpea Crunch** (30 min)  
* **Courgette-Oat Fritters** (3 min/side)  
* **Seed Bread** (55 min)  
* **Apple-Cinnamon Oat Energy Balls** (no-bake)  
* **White-Bean & Aubergine Hummus** (roast + blitz)  

Add one snack whenever the oven is already on.
