# Meal Plan

### 4-Day Minimal-Waste Meal Plan (Mon → Thu)

| Day  | Breakfast ★ = light | Lunch | Dinner → next-day leftovers |
|------|---------------------|-------|-----------------------------|
| **Mon** | **Chia bowl** (chia + almond milk + coconut yoghurt + pumpkin seeds) ★ | Seed-bread + hummus & avocado, spinach-rocket-tomato salad | **Sheet-Pan Salmon** with sweet-potato cubes, broccoli & green beans |
| **Tue** | Eggs, avocado & side salad ★ | Left-over Salmon tray | **Bene Salad** (mango, feta, cucumber, tomato, coriander, lime-cashew crunch) + **Roasted Chickpea Crunch** |
| **Wed** | **Chia bowl** with cinnamon ★ | Left-over Bene Salad | **Herb-Roasted Chicken Thighs** with carrots, courgettes & broccoli |
| **Thu** | Eggs, avocado & side salad ★ | Left-over Chicken tray | **Courgette-Oat Fritters** with roasted broccoli-sweet-potato hash |

**Side/Starter Salad (makes 2 portions)**  
Spinach + rocket + chopped tomato, dressed with olive oil, lemon juice & a pinch of salt.

★ = deliberately lighter meal for gentle intake  
Each dinner is cooked in double quantity so the next day's lunch is simply reheated leftovers.
