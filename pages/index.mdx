# Energy Flow Knowledge Base

Welcome! I'm **Charlie Ellington** and this small site is my living knowledge hubâ€”an ever-evolving collection of notes, plans and guiding principles that keep me (and collaborators) in _energy flow_.

> **Energy flow** is the sweet spot where work is challenging, skill-building and genuinely valuable for people and planetâ€”while still leaving room for family, health and community.

## What you'll find here

â€¢ **Developer docs** â€“ end-to-end contributor guides, build loops, and coding standards that power every project (see *02 Developer Docs*).

â€¢ **Project dossiers** â€“ bullet-proof context for each active venture (Waitlist App, Zebra Design, No Bad Parts Collective, *Sunni.be* and more).

â€¢ **Life tools & systems** â€“ distilled tactics on 4-hour focus days, deep-work rhythms, meal-planning, and automations that slash shallow work.

â€¢ **Operating principles** â€“ the three core questions I live by, plus notes on compassionate productivity, building evergreen assets, and what "wealth" really means.

Everything is pure markdown/MDX so it can be loaded directly into Cursor for contextual coding sessions or served publicly as docs.

## Why this exists

1. **Single source of truth**  
   No more scattered Google Docs or Notion pages. One repo â†’ one deployment.
2. **Context for pair programming**  
   When I invite an AI assistant (or a human collaborator) into a codebase, they can pull rich project context instantly.
3. **Public transparency**  
   Friends, clients and future teammates can peek at how I think, plan and ship.
