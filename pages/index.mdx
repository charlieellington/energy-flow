# Energy Flow Knowledge Base

Welcome! I'm **Charlie Ellington** and this small site is my living knowledge hubâ€”an ever-evolving collection of notes, plans and guiding principles that keep me (and collaborators) in _energy flow_.

> **Energy flow** is the sweet spot where work is challenging, skill-building and genuinely valuable for people and planetâ€”while still leaving room for family, health and community.

## What you'll find here

â€¢ **Project dossiers** â€“ bullet-proof context for each active venture (Zebra Design, IFS Community, Children's Books Platform, *Sunni.be* and more).

â€¢ **Systems & processes** â€“ short write-ups on 4-hour focus days, deep-work tactics, automation to slash shallow work, and tools that protect my time and health.

â€¢ **Principles & philosophy** â€“ the three core questions I live by, plus notes on compassionate productivity, building evergreen assets, and what "wealth" really means.

Everything is pure markdown so it can be loaded directly into Cursor for contextual coding sessions or served publicly as docs.

## Why this exists

1. **Single source of truth**  
   No more scattered Google Docs or Notion pages. One repo â†’ one deployment.
2. **Context for pair programming**  
   When I invite an AI assistant (or a human collaborator) into a codebase, they can pull rich project context instantly.
3. **Public transparency**  
   Friends, clients and future teammates can peek at how I think, plan and ship.
