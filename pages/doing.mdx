## Doing Next 




--- 

**Current Main Focus: / Must Haves*
### Sport
- Go outside and sport - you have time! 

### Post a design tool a day 
- PACT 
- Some will be videos 
- Add value every time - you're adding value to the audience bank, withdraw ( promote ) only when enough deposits made.

**Should have:** 

### Content Process 
- Create a video and a manageable PACT to keep up the audience 
- If not a video, do an image post and design/AI tool 

### Zebradesign.io as a tool 
- Make a tool with Idea, Build, Test, Work with me 
- Fix all bugs and finish the site design 
- Finish and polish the work with me page (or simplify it)
- Take the code of the work me page (deep research github) and create instructions to move the about page over to the new site. 
- Put placeholders in the case studies and how to docs

**Could have:**

### Zebradesign.io
