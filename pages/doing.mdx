## Doing Next

**Before reordering anything:** 
- Conclusion of + - N metacognition is that you need to release to answer all your hypotheses, release sooner. 

### 01 :: Content Process 
- Set up process for you and Bene, Sunni, to follow: PACT, How to record/create, outsource edit?, how to post. 

### 01b :: Content Process :: Make one video 
- Did this but ran into errors and needs a restart 

### 02b :: Minor Tweaks
- Add intercomm to energyflow.studio and nobadpartscollective.com 

‚òùÔ∏è This is done 
üìç You are here 
üëá and this is next 

### 02 :: Sharing No Bad Parts Collective 
- (1hr timecap) 
- Share with a few people and gather sign ups - MARKET FIRST PRINCIPLE 
- See the scratchpad for features and ideas on Market First and payments 
- Keep enough time to code the proof of concept 

### 03 :: Start Coding the proof of concept 
- energyflow.studio/projects/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan - follow the build plan here 
- But first: Review the implementation plan of no bad parts - does it need a video set up or just a listener like¬†a note taking app with the instructions in a seperate browser for a v1 
- Goal is to do a 1:1 call with someone in next week and have sign-ups 

‚òùÔ∏è Above down end of Friday
