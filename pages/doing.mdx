title: "01 Doing Next"

## Next 

What went well: 
- Having a timer but I wanted to go over when I hadn't completed the bug I was on and that took 45mins 

Where are you: 

- See the scratchpad to see exactly 

What to load up: 

- Cursor project 
- Run local dev on energy flow at 3010 
- You can then see http://localhost:3010/03-projects/Waitlist-app/scratchpad-waitlist for a rich text version of where you're at 
- Run local dev on waitlist so you can see it at 3000 
- also useful: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rhnujzqwkiibkddbpyql/auth/users 

When you're ready: 

Check @scratchpad-waitlist.md for the next task - is there anything you need to be 100% confident to complete the next tasks?

## Doing Next

Rough overview of what I want to do next: 

### 01 :: Waitlist app 
- That can be deployed on Vercel and maybe used by others 

### 02 :: Creating the landing page for No Bad Parts Collective 
- Build on top of the new waitlist app 
- Use this copy + https://www.notion.so/charlieellington/No-Bad-Parts-Collective-COMING-SOON-1fa9aa118f8c80faa1e5d9916b992082
- Plus the project build plan context you did earlier 
- Add a "building in the open" tab with the setting up plan from the above 

### 02 :: Sharing No Bad Parts Collective 
- Share with a few people and gather sign ups - MARKET FIRST PRINCIPLE 

### 03 :: Start Coding the proof of concept 
- energyflow.studio/projects/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan - follow the build plan here 
- Goal is to do a 1:1 call with someone in next week and have sign-ups
