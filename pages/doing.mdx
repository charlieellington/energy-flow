## Doing Next

Rough overview of what I want to do next: 

### 01 :: Waitlist app 
- That can be deployed on Vercel and maybe used by others 

### 02 :: Content Process 
- Set up process for you and Bene, Sunni, to follow: PACT, How to record/create, outsource edit?, how to post. 
- look at https://www.creatorspotlight.com/p/hayley-rose 

### 03 :: Creating the landing page for No Bad Parts Collective 
- Build on top of the new waitlist app 
- Use this copy + https://www.notion.so/charlieellington/No-Bad-Parts-Collective-COMING-SOON-1fa9aa118f8c80faa1e5d9916b992082
- Plus the project build plan context you did earlier 
- Add a "building in the open" tab with the setting up plan from the above 

### 04 :: Sharing No Bad Parts Collective 
- Share with a few people and gather sign ups - MARKET FIRST PRINCIPLE 

### 05 :: Start Coding the proof of concept 
- energyflow.studio/projects/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan - follow the build plan here 
- Goal is to do a 1:1 call with someone in next week and have sign-ups
