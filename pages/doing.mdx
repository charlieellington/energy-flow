## Doing Next

Rough overview of what I want to do next: 

### 01 :: Creating the landing page for No Bad Parts Collective 
- Use this copy + https://www.notion.so/charlieellington/No-Bad-Parts-Collective-COMING-SOON-1fa9aa118f8c80faa1e5d9916b992082
- Plus the project build plan context you did earlier 
- Use the waitlist app as your template as that is awesome 
- Add a "building in the open" tab with the setting up plan from the above 

### 02 :: Sharing No Bad Parts Collective 
- Share with a few people and gather sign ups - MARKET FIRST PRINCIPLE 

### 03 :: Start Coding the proof of concept 
- energyflow.studio/projects/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan - follow the build plan here 
- Goal is to do a 1:1 call with someone in next week and have sign-ups
