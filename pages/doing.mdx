## Next :: 30 May 

Energy Flow Set-up 
- Set a timer 
- What feeling and what are you going to do when you stop. 
- Stop at ??? to feel XXX and do YYY 

## Plan Today and Why 

THIS FIRST: 
- Freezing waitlist and duplicating 
- see energy-flow/pages/02-developer-docs/waitlist-freeze-duplicate.md for how to do it

- Also, fix the energy flow docs issue

THEN: 
- Add the basic copy (headline only) not the full thing for No Bad Parts 
- BECAUSE you want this out almost immediately so that... 

THEN AND NEXT BIG DAY TASK: 
- Prioritise content process for you and Bene (see 02 below)

## Plan Next Days 

- Create a more detailed landing for No Bad Parts (see 03 below)
- v.1 of Sunni launch (see notes in Sunni folder)
- Market No Bad Parts (See 05 - marketing first principle as you build)
- Build the call functionality of No Bad Parts 

The aim is to have done that in 10 days so you go to FKC Viana with: 

- Sunni launched 
- No bad parts sign up launched 
- A demo you can show on your phone for No Bad Parts video calls 
- Waitlist app 

Where are you: 

Check @scratchpad-waitlist.md for the next task - is there anything you need to be 100% confident to complete the next tasks?

## Doing Next

Rough overview of what I want to do next: 

### 01 :: Waitlist app 
- That can be deployed on Vercel and maybe used by others 

‚òùÔ∏è Did most of this but not finished for others. On Pause 
üìç You are here 
üëá and this is next 

### 02 :: Content Process 
- Set up process for you and Bene, Sunni, to follow: PACT, How to record/create, outsource edit?, how to post. 
- look at https://www.creatorspotlight.com/p/hayley-rose 

### 03 :: Creating the landing page for No Bad Parts Collective 
- Build on top of the new waitlist app 
- Use this copy + https://www.notion.so/charlieellington/No-Bad-Parts-Collective-COMING-SOON-1fa9aa118f8c80faa1e5d9916b992082
- Plus the project build plan context you did earlier 
- Add a "building in the open" tab with the setting up plan from the above 

### 04 :: Sunni v1 
- Launched 

### 05 :: Sharing No Bad Parts Collective 
- Share with a few people and gather sign ups - MARKET FIRST PRINCIPLE 

### 06 :: Start Coding the proof of concept 
- energyflow.studio/projects/no-bad-parts-collective/build-plan - follow the build plan here 
- Goal is to do a 1:1 call with someone in next week and have sign-ups 

### 07 :: Waitlist app 
- Return to the waitlist app for the backlog to get this live for others
