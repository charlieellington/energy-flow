## Proposal & Landing Page Outline (Notes)

**Headline/Tagline:**

Zebra Design 

Designers that code with AI 

Idea to tested product in weeks, not in months 

Made for startup founders, small-medium businesses and product teams. 

A design as a service modal to design **and** develop your app lightening fast. 

[Book Intro Call]   [Examples]

EXAMPLES 

Things I've build in Cursor: 
- IFS application 
- Waitlist app 
- Sunni 
I've spent the last three months amazed by what I can build using AI. Zebra design now takes a design centric approach to design and build your next product. 

Things I've Designed and Experience: 
- MakerDAO 
- Ethereum 
- Ramp Network 
- Nexus Mutual 
I founded a design studio that designed cutting-edge products with some of the web3 space leading teams. Our methodology was central to fast product market fit and user driven scientific processes. I now take the same approach going to code rather than delivering Figma designs.

“Only hire people who are either going to **write code or go out and get users**, because those are the only things you need at first.” - Paul Graham, The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups, **This is what I've based Zebra Design on**

Typical approaches: 

        - _“6-month dev estimates turning into 12-month nightmares”_
            
        - _“Designs that don’t match what developers build”_
            
        - _“Freelancers who disappear or get priorities wrong”_
            
        - _“Burning cash without validated learning”_.

A Different Approach using AI coding: Design and Code, Unified. Product and Users First. 

We run a rapid design sprint with your stakeholders, build your prototype **in code** (not just static mockups), and test it with real users – all in a few weeks. Then, as we iterate, we’re your on-call product team delivering new features on a subscription model. No more delays or runaway costs.

What to expect: 

(this section is squares)

Workshops 
Rapidly align stakeholders and the domain experts in the design process. No more tedious feedback loops as designers and developers fail to understand the problem. 

Prototype in Code
We design high-fidelity UI and build the front-end in real code - the finished product! In days instead of months for your first MVP. 

User Testing
We conduct rapid user tests on the MVP to gather feedback. No more months of building the wrong thing and user-centric decisions made to continue the product. 

Continuous Build 
We implement feedback, continue developing (e.g. connect the backend), and polish with a user-centric design to code approach. Ongoing, we add features _on demand_ via your subscription.

**Speed:** _Idea to clickable product in ~2-4 weeks._ (Use a lightning icon)

**Validated Results:** _Built-in user testing to ensure your product hits the mark._ (target icon or checkmark icon)

**Clear Pricing**: One agreed monthly price, unlimited design and code requests, no surprise bills. Pause or cancel anytime.

**Quality Design**: Beautiful, consistent UI and pride in details. Using front-end UI library's to speed up going to market which are focused on optimal User Experience. Don't be slowed down by custom designs that don't move the needle. 






        
    - **Full-Stack Option:** _Front-end, backend, whatever you need. We can deliver a complete product, not just sketches._ (server/cloud icon)
        
    - **Stakeholder Alignment:** _Collaborative workshops include your team’s knowledge. Everyone moves in one direction from day one._ (teamwork icon)
        
- **Pricing Section:**
    
    - Possibly display the two plan tiers in a simple table or two columns:
        
        - _Front-End Accelerator – $X/month_ (brief bullet list: “Coded UI prototype”, “Unlimited design requests (1 at a time)”, “1 round user testing included”, “Cancel anytime”, “Workshops billed as needed”).
            
        - _Full-Stack Partner – $Y/month_ (bullets: “Includes back-end & integrations”, “Unlimited feature requests”, “Priority support”, “User testing included”, “Cancel anytime”).
            
    - Below plans, a note: “_Meetings & workshops are available as add-ons at an hourly rate — you only pay for the face-time you need._” This reinforces that the core work is efficient and asynchronous, but also that we value our time.
        
    - Also mention something like: _“Not sure which plan? Let’s chat. We can also do a one-month pilot to prove the value.”_ This lowers risk for them.
        
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done oriented blurb:**
    
    - Maybe a section titled **“Who Is This For?”** and list scenarios:
        
        - _“I’m a startup founder who needs to test a new app idea ASAP.”_
            
        - _“We’re an SME that needs a custom internal tool built without derailing our engineering team.”_
            
        - _“I have an MVP, but no design — I need a UX/UI overhaul and new features fast.”_
            
        - _“We need our product to finally start moving forward; freelancers and agencies have let us down.”_
            
    - Each scenario could have a one-liner of how we help (e.g., “We’ll run a sprint and get you a validated prototype so you can confidently pitch it or onboard beta users.”). This essentially incorporates the JTBD messaging directly into the landing page, showing we understand their “job to be done.”
        
- **Process Details / Why It Works:**
    
    - A more detailed explanation of the workflow. Could be in an FAQ or an expanded timeline section:
        
        - Q: _“How can you deliver so fast?”_ – A: Because we’ve **streamlined the process**. We start with your knowledge (no wasted time), use efficient tools (AI-assisted coding, etc.), and focus on core features first. Also we work **iteratively** – you see progress in days.
            
        - Q: _“What does ‘unlimited requests’ really mean?”_ – A: Exactly that – request as many features or designs as you want. We tackle them one or two at a time to maintain quality[awesomic.com](https://www.awesomic.com/blog/unlimited-development-subscription-why-is-it-worth-it-for-scaleups-and-enterprises#:~:text=The%20core%20advantage%20of%20this,another%20subscription%20increases%20the%20number). You’ll never be charged more for asking for extra work in a given month; it’s all included. (We’ll be transparent about realistic timelines for larger requests.)
            
        - Q: _“Can you work with our existing team?”_ – A: Absolutely. We can act as an extra team member, focusing on front-end or prototypes while your team does other work. Or we can take a whole project off their plate. We play nice with developers – our code is clean and maintainable (we can even involve your devs early to ensure a smooth handover if needed).
            
        - Q: _“What if I just need design or just development?”_ – A: That’s fine too. Our front-end plan is essentially **design in code** – perfect if you only require UX/UI help. If you have designs and need them built, we can do dev only as well. The model is flexible: you’re subscribing to get outcomes (designs or features built), not to employ a person 40hrs/week.
            
        - Q: _“Is there a commitment?”_ – A: No long-term contracts. **Month-to-month, cancel any time**[hatchwise.com](https://www.hatchwise.com/resources/an-honest-review-of-designjoy-design-agency#:~:text=,Pause%20or%20cancel%20anytime). Some clients engage for 1-2 months to kickstart a project; others stick around for continuous growth. It’s up to you.
            
- **Case Study or Example Section:**
    
    - If you have a success story (even if hypothetical for now), outline it:
        
        - _“Client X, a solo founder, had an idea for a fintech app. In 3 weeks, we went from a blank slate to a fully designed and coded prototype of their core product on web and mobile. We tested it with 5 target users, gathered feedback, and iterated. By week 4, they had a refined MVP that secured them early investors/customers.”_ (Include before-after or a screenshot if available).
            
    - Another mini-example: _“Y Company needed an internal dashboard. Rather than divert their engineering team, they subscribed to our service. In one month, we built and launched their tool. It’s now in daily use while we continue to add features on the unlimited plan.”_
        
    - These stories make the offering tangible. On the landing page, could be a carousel or simply a couple of paragraphs with outcomes (metrics if possible: e.g., “saved X months of dev time,” “cut costs by 50% compared to agency quote,” etc.).
        
- **About/Why Us:**
    
    - A brief founder’s note: _“After years running design sprints for Fortune 500s and startups (at DeepWork Studio) and seeing projects stall in development, I knew there had to be a better way. This service is the result: a lean, fast, no-BS approach to design and development.”_
        
    - Highlight experience: e.g., “10+ years in UX/design, projects for [industry names], plus software engineering skills.” This builds credibility.
        
    - Perhaps mention _“Powered by the latest tools (AI, codegen, etc.) but with human creativity at the helm”_ – to assure it’s quality + speed.
        
- **Call to Action (CTA) Section:**
    
    - End with a strong CTA: _“Ready to launch faster? – Let’s chat.”_
        
    - Maybe offer a free consultation or demo: _“Book a free 30-minute strategy call to see if it’s a fit. In it, we’ll discuss your project and even sketch out a quick action plan – whether or not you sign up.”_ This reduces risk of reaching out.
        
    - The CTA button/link for booking or contacting should be repeated (also one up in the hero).
        
- **Footer:**
    
    - Could list things like “Service by [Your Name] – ex-DeepWork Studio” etc., and maybe links to any docs or terms.
        
    - Also include “FAQs” or “Contact info” if not covered above. Possibly a link to the DeepWork case studies or blog for further reading (to demonstrate background).
