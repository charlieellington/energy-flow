## 2025-06-07 Updates
- Started local dev servers for both energy-flow and waitlist-landing projects.
- Both are running in parallel for development.
- Default port for each is http://localhost:3000 (change one if needed to avoid conflict).
- Identified Webpack/Nextra cache warnings (`Can't resolve './__temp__'`); build still succeeds so treating as non-blocking perf issue for now.
- Attempted upgrade to nextra 4.x but this introduced breaking changes (unrecognized 'theme', 'themeConfig' keys).
- Reverted back to working versions: nextra 2.6.1, nextra-theme-docs 2.6.1, Next.js 13.3.0, TypeScript 4.9.5.
- Dev server is now functional again with original harmless webpack warnings.

## 2025-05-21 Updates
- Added ðŸŒˆ emoji to branding across the site (logo, default title, OG tags, image alt) in `theme.config.tsx`.
- Created `public/favicon.svg` with rainbow emoji and linked it as the new favicon via `theme.config.tsx` head.
- Updated LinkedIn chat icon in `theme.config.tsx` to a circular variant (#0A66C2 background, white "in") for visual consistency.
- Added "Contact" page (`pages/05 :: Contact.mdx`) with embedded Cal.com Booker calendar and installed `@calcom/atoms` dependency.
- Fixed stray character at end of Contact page and ensured it uses `MONTH_VIEW` layout.
- Restructured routes: renamed spaced pages & folders to slug-friendly names (`doing.mdx`, `developer-docs/`, `life-tools/`, `projects/`) so URLs work again. Removed old spaced variants and temporarily deleted Contact page pending fix.

## 2025-05-29 Updates
- Added `.eslintrc.json` extending `next/core-web-vitals` so ESLint can run non-interactively.
- Pinned `eslint` to `8.57.0` and `eslint-config-next` to `13.3.0` in `package.json` to match Next.js 13 tooling.
- Installed new devDependencies and regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Verified project compiles (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`), builds (`pnpm run build`), and passes lint (`pnpm exec next lint`).
- Committed and pushed changes to `main` branch.

## 2025-05-30 Updates
- Revised `pages/02-developer-docs/waitlist-freeze-duplicate.md` to provide explicit manual commands, clarify Cursor workspace steps, and improve overall clarity of freeze-and-duplicate process.
- Completed Step 1: fixed lint/type issues (relaxed some ESLint rules, updated code). Build succeeded; committed and tagged public snapshot `v1.0.0`, pushed to GitHub.
- Added troubleshooting note to Freeze & Duplicate doc about temporarily relaxing ESLint rules.
- Mirrored `waitlist-landing` into new private repo `no-bad-parts-landing` via bare clone; pushed `main` + tags.
- Added `pageExtensions` to `next.config.mjs` so `.md` files render; affected pages now appear on live site.
- Added desktop sidebar toggle (button in navbar) with `SidebarToggle` component and CSS.

## 2025-06-06 15:45 â€“ PLAN A & B EXECUTION COMPLETE âœ…

### Issue Resolved: App/Pages Router Conflict
â€¢ **Root Cause**: Empty `app/session/` directories conflicting with `pages/session/` routes
â€¢ **Solution**: Removed `app/session/` directories to let Pages Router work properly
â€¢ **Result**: Both routes now return HTTP 200 OK

### Plan A - Fix Current Breakage âœ…
1. **Stopped processes**: Cleared port conflicts  
2. **Cleaned artifacts**: `rm -rf .next` (removed corrupted cache)
3. **Code verification**: All edits were already correctly applied:
   - `components/livekit-wrapper.tsx` âœ… ("use client", brand bar, modern props)
   - `pages/session/facilitator.tsx` âœ… (RoomEvent enum, type safety)
4. **Build tests**: `npm run lint` + `npx tsc --noEmit` passed âœ…
5. **Routes fixed**: 
   - http://localhost:3000/session/partner â†’ **200 OK** âœ…
   - http://localhost:3000/session/facilitator â†’ **200 OK** âœ…

### Plan B - Prevention Measures âœ…
â€¢ **Created `.cursorrules`** with project-specific guidelines
â€¢ **Repository distinction rules**: no-bad-parts/ vs energy-flow/
â€¢ **Mandatory verification steps**: read_file after edits
â€¢ **Router architecture**: Pages Router only, no App Router conflicts
â€¢ **Build hygiene**: lint/tsc checks, clean restarts
â€¢ **Security reminders**: API key handling, CONTRIBUTING.md compliance

### Current Status: READY FOR STEP 4.5 
â€¢ **Front-end complete** with brand bar and LiveKit best practices
â€¢ **Routes working** on port 3000  
â€¢ **Next step**: Local Integration Test with Python agent
â€¢ **Architecture**: Partner â†” LiveKit Room â†” Facilitator (with brand headers)

## Documentation Site (energy-flow) - CLEANED UP

### Cleanup Completed (Latest)
- Successfully removed all non-documentation code from energy-flow repo
- Deleted files:
  - `components/livekit-wrapper.tsx`
  - `components/local-camera-tile.tsx`
  - `pages/session/facilitator.tsx`
  - `pages/session/partner.tsx`
  - `pages/_app.tsx`
  - `scripts/dummy-hints.js`
  - `tailwind.config.ts`
  - `app/` directory (was empty)
  - `pages/session/` directory
- Reverted package.json to remove:
  - `@livekit/components-react`
  - `@livekit/components-styles`
  - TypeScript 5.0 (reverted to 4.9.5)
  - React type definitions
- Build now succeeds: `npm run build` âœ…
- TypeScript checking passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` âœ…
- Vercel deployments should now work correctly

### Current State
- Pure documentation site using Nextra
- No application code or LiveKit dependencies
- Ready for deployment on Vercel
- All session/LiveKit code should be moved to the no-bad-parts repo

### Reference
- Cleanup plan documented in: `pages/02-developer-docs/fix.md`
- Last known good commit before mixing code: `f079b8f` (2025-06-06)

## Recent Updates

### Vercel Deployment Fix (Latest)
- Fixed deployment failure due to missing LiveKit dependencies
- Added `@livekit/components-react` and `@livekit/components-styles` to package.json
- Created missing `components/local-camera-tile.tsx` component
- Both session routes should now build successfully

### Session Pages Structure
- Using pages router: `pages/session/facilitator.tsx` and `pages/session/partner.tsx`
- Both pages use the `LKWrapper` component from `components/livekit-wrapper.tsx`
- Facilitator page shows local camera and AI hint stream
- Partner page shows just the local camera

## 2025-07-17 Updates
- Added `pages/05-life-tools/meal-plan-july.md` containing a 3-day waste-free meal collection (breakfasts, main meals, light salads).
- Followed meal-planning-context guidelines; shopping list excludes pancake base ingredients and snacks.
