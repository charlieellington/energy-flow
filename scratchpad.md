## 2025-05-21 Updates
- Added ðŸŒˆ emoji to branding across the site (logo, default title, OG tags, image alt) in `theme.config.tsx`.
- Created `public/favicon.svg` with rainbow emoji and linked it as the new favicon via `theme.config.tsx` head.
- Updated LinkedIn chat icon in `theme.config.tsx` to a circular variant (#0A66C2 background, white "in") for visual consistency.
- Added "Contact" page (`pages/05 :: Contact.mdx`) with embedded Cal.com Booker calendar and installed `@calcom/atoms` dependency.
- Fixed stray character at end of Contact page and ensured it uses `MONTH_VIEW` layout.
- Restructured routes: renamed spaced pages & folders to slug-friendly names (`doing.mdx`, `developer-docs/`, `life-tools/`, `projects/`) so URLs work again. Removed old spaced variants and temporarily deleted Contact page pending fix.
